            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>NExt to the full and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Viſion and Fruition of the God of Glory above, the greateſt happineſs of Souls lies in Union and Communion with Chriſt here: Nor indeed can we ever attain unto the one without an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the other. Now to bring thee into, and build thee up in this Union and Communion with Chriſt, and thereby to fit and diſpoſe thee for that glorious Viſion and Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Above, is the principal deſign of the enſuing Diſcourſe. If thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt a reaſon of the publication hereof, I deſire thee to ſatisfie thy ſelf with this; God in his all-wiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Providence, hath ſeen good now for ſeyeral months to call the unworthy Author out of his Vinyard, and lodge him in a ſick Chamber; and he alſo ſeems to be ſpeedily calling him out of this World, and to bring that Night upon him wherein no man can work, wherein nothing is to be done either
<pb facs="tcp:94533:3"/>for God or a Man's Soul, <hi>John</hi> 9.4. And being never like to do more for Chriſt on Earth, he was willing, in hopes of advancing his dear Lords Kingdom, in the drawing of Sinners to him, and building up of Saints in him, &amp; communion with him, to make theſe poor Contemplations publick. God was pleaſed ſome few years ſince to make a more than ordinary uſe of the preaching of them, many Souls being through his Grace eſpouſed to Chriſt and more brought nearer to him thereby: and had I not ſome hopes that he would alſo, through that ſame Grace of his, make ſome uſe of the reading of them for thy good, and the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I think they had never ſeen the light: Thy good then, and Chriſt's Glory in the enlargement of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is the thing aimed at herein, which the good Lord by his Grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh. I am lying daily by the brink of the Grave, waiting upon the Will, and for the Call of my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord; the only reaſon ſwaying with me to deſire life, next to the more through working out of my own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is to reveal, and make known
<pb facs="tcp:94533:3"/>Chriſt to Souls, and to publiſh the glad Tydings of Peace and Salvation to a loſt and ſinful World: But if God will make no further uſe of me that way, his Will be done. I comfort my ſelf with what an holy Man ſpeaks, <hi>Sinleſs glorifying of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſinful glorifying of God.</hi> His meaning I ſuppoſe is, that 'tis better to glorifie God in a ſinleſs than in a ſinful ſtate: Truly bere we ſin in our beſt Actions; and if we bring a little glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God, yet woe and alas! how much diſhonour do we alſo bring him? and what iniquities do there cleave to our moſt holy things? But above we ſhall glorifie him without ſinning; we ſhall love him, praiſe him, admire him, adore him, delight in him, and aſcribe glory to him without the leaſt taint or tincture of ſin cleaving thereunto; having not only all tears wiped off our eyes; but which is infinitly, infinitly, infinitly better, all ſin purged from our hearts and actions. Farewel, I leave thee and this poor Treatiſe to the Bleſſing of Heaven.</p>

            <p>THere are two main ends for which the <hi>Goſpel-Miniſtry</hi> is ordained; the one is, the <hi>winning</hi> of Souls, and bringing them into Chriſt; the other is the <hi>edification</hi> and building up of ſuch as are already brought in. It hath pleaſed Chriſt, the Head of the Church, who diſtributeth Gifts in order to the ſalvation of men, unto whom, and in what meaſure he pleaſeth, to furniſh the Author of this Diſcourſe, with good abilities as to both theſe Works. As to the firſt, the Lord had given him a peculiar Gift, to qualifie him above many, to Preach the Goſpel for the winning of Souls; and the Grace of God in him did inflame his heart with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſires, and did excite great longings in him after the converſion of Souls; and he was pleaſed to crown his own Gifts and Grace in him with great ſucceſs, many a Soul having been turned unto God by his Labours. And it having pleaſed God to caſt the Author into a languiſhing Diſtemper for ſome months, whereby he was wholly taken off from his Work in Preaching, ſo great did the deſire of doing good to Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in him, and ſuch were the yearnings of his Bowels towards them, that being not able to ſpeak to them any longer out of the Pulpit, he could not ſatisfie himſelf, but he muſt needs ſpeak to them in this ſmall Tract, wherein his great Scope and principal Deſign is, to allure and
<pb facs="tcp:94533:4"/>draw Souls unto Chriſt. As to the Matter of the <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> I need ſay little, it will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſpeak for it ſelf; onely thus much I may ſay, <hi>Union</hi> with Chriſt is the foundation of our Happineſs. The Apoſtle telleth us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1, 27.</note> that <hi>Chriſt in us is the hope of Glory;</hi> We cannot have any ſure or ſound title to eternal Life and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt; whoever are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are ſaved by being brought under Chriſt as their Head. <hi>Epheſ. 1.10.

There are but two <hi>Roots</hi> of Mankind, the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> is the Root of Sin and Death unto all that abide in him; the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> is the Root of Righteouſneſs and Life unto all who are implanted into him. The ſcope of this Diſcourſe, is to perſwade men not to be content to abide in the Root upon which they naturally grow, <hi>viz.</hi> the Root of the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> but to ſeek after a new Relation unto Chriſt the <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi> The Arguments by which the Author preſſeth Souls to come to Chriſt, are moſt pathetical and ſtrong; and as there is a Vein of Heavenly Affection which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth through the whole body of the Diſcourſe to allure ſuch who are yet ſtrangers to the Lord Jeſus to fall in love with him, ſo there is much
<pb facs="tcp:94533:5"/>ſolid Matter interwoven, whereby thoſe who are already called, and have attained to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with ſpiritual things, may receive farther advantage. It pleaſeth the Al-wiſe God to leave the Author at a great uncertainty as to Life; the Lord hath kept him in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace long, but he hath choſen and refined him in it; and whether it be in this, or in the other World, that he ſhall pleaſe to bring him forth, they who have moſt intimate converſe with him, are perſwaded, he will <hi>come forth as Gold.</hi> The Lord grant that the ſame preſence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, which attended theſe Sermons in the Preaching of them, may accompany them in the Publication, that many more Souls may be enamoured and drawn to the love of that faireſt of ten thouſand, the Lord Jeſus; that ſo knowing him, and adhering to him, they may be ſaved eternally by him, by whom all that have been, are, or ſhall be ſaved, are brought to Life and Glory: So prayes,</p>

There is the Perſonal Marriage, and that is between the Perſon of the Son of God, the Second Perſon in the Trinity, and our Nature: This <hi>Calvin</hi> calls, <hi>Verbum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnatum,</hi> the Incarnate Word; or, as the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>the Word made Fleſh,</hi> John 1.14. this we generally call the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical Union.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the Myſtical Marriage; and that is between the Perſon of Chriſt, God-Man, and the Perſon of Believers, as Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant here on Earth; whole Chriſt, and the whole Believer being made one: this the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls, <hi>A being joyned to the Lord, and being one Spirit with him,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. and this we uſually call the Spiritual Union.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is the Heavenly Marriage; and that is between Chriſt and the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant above; which indeed is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the two former; and this I would call the Glorious Union: and what that is I can't tell, but do hope am going to ſee, — In the firſt of theſe lies the foundation of all our happineſs; by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, we are brought into an initial par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of it; by the third, we are put into the full poſſeſſion and enjoyment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for ever.

               <p>BUt what is this Eſpouſal or Marriage-relation between Chriſt and Believers?

                  </note> which indeed is a great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, that is, an hidden ſecret Thing; a thing hid from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon, and not to be underſtood but by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and the Light of the Holy Spirit. So far as we apprehend it, you may take this ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in general of it: 'Tis that ſpiritual conjunction or relation that is between Chriſt and Bellevers, between the Perſon of Chriſt and the Perſon of Believers, ariſing from his inhabitation in them by his Spirit, and their cloſe with him by Faith. Much might be ſaid for the opening of this general Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94533:8"/>but I ſhall wave it, and give you the true nature of the thing, under conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more particularly, as carrying theſe five things in it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. Free and cordial Donation.</item>

               </list>
               <p n="1">I. This Eſpouſal or Marriage-relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and Believers, carries in it free and cordial Donation; a giving of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves each to other. In Marriages or Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, the Parties give themſelves each to other; the Husband gives himſelf unto the Wife, and the Wife, by way of return, gives her ſelf unto the Husband; they conſent to take each other in that relation, and accordingly do give up themſelves each to other: So in this Spiritual Eſpouſal, or Marriage-relation between Chriſt and his People, there is a giving of themſelves each to other; they conſent to take each other, and accordingly do give up themſelves each to other. — Chriſt, on the one hand, gives himſelf unto the Soul: I will be thine, ſayes he, to the Soul; thine to love thee; thine to ſave thee; thine to make thee happy in me, and with me: I, with all my Riches and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, will be fully and for ever thine: <hi>I will be for thee;</hi> that is the language of his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94533:8"/>Eſpouſing Love unto the Soul, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.3. And oh how ſweet is this Language! What can Chriſt give to poor Souls like himſelf? In giving himſelf, he gives the beſt Gift that either Heaven or Earth affords: In giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, he gives Life, he gives Peace, he gives Grace, he gives Righteouſneſs, he gives the favour of God, he gives Heaven, he gives all. Oh ſweet Gift! — On the other hand, the Soul by way of return gives himſelf to Chriſt: I will be thine, ſayes the Soul to Chriſt, I will be for thee and not for another: Hence 'tis ſaid, <hi>They gave themſelves to the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.5. they freely and willingly yeelded up themſelves to Chriſt, to be his, and his for ever; Sweet Jeſus, ſuch as I am, and have, I give to thee. I am a poor, a ſorry Gift (ſayes the Soul) infinitely unworthy of thine acceptance; my beſt is too bad, my All is too little for thee: but ſeeing 'tis thy pleaſure to call for, and accept of ſuch a Gift at my hands, I do with my whole Soul give up my Self, my Strength, my Time, my Talents, my All for ever to thee. And though, the truth is, this be a ſorry Gift, yet you little think, how pleaſing, how grateful it is to Chriſt, and what a value he puts upon it. You have the whole of this owned and aſſerted by the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. This Eſpouſal or Marriage-relation between Chriſt and Believers, carries in it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94533:9"/>near and intimate union. In Marriage there is a very near union and conjunction between the Parties: As they give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves each to other, ſo they become one each with other; <hi>They are no more twain, but one fleſh,</hi> Mat. 19.6. So in this Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, or Marriage-relation between Chriſt and Believers, there is a very near union and conjunction between them; they two are made one; and thus the Apoſtle ſets forth the Marriage between Chriſt and them, Epheſ. 5.31, 32. <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a man leave Father and Mother, and ſhall be joyned unto his Wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh. This is a great Myſtery; but I ſpake concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt and the Church,</hi> that is, I ſpeak of the Marriage-relation which is between Chriſt and the Church, which conſiſts in union: Hence alſo Believers are ſaid <hi>to be joyned to the Lord, and to be one Spirit with him,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. So that eſpouſing to Chriſt, and being joyned to Chriſt, are all one. The truth is, herein lies the very ſoul and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Spiritual Marriage, <hi>viz.</hi> in a ſpiritual union between Chriſt and the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: though Chriſt and the Soul were two before; two, that were ſtrangers each to other, yet in this Marriage or Eſpouſal they become one, and ſo one, as that all the World can never make them two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, never diſſolve this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note n="*" place="margin">Sponſi &amp; ſponſae uſitatâ, at omnium jucun diſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94533:9"/>learned Man hath obſerved) <hi>is expreſſed and ſet forth the Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Church, Chriſt and every Holy Soul.</hi> And this Union is a full Union, an Union between the whole Perſon of Chriſt, and the whole Perſon of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; the whole Perſon of Chriſt is united unto the Believer, and the whole Perſon of the Believer is united unto Chriſt.<note place="margin">Neque anima neſtra ſola cum ſolâ Chriſti animâ, neque care noſtra ſola cum ſolâ Chriſti carne, ſed tota cujuſque fidelis perſona cum totâ Chriſti perſonâ conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur. <hi>Zanch.</hi>

                  <hi>Neither is our Soul alone</hi> (ſaith a Learned Man) <hi>joyned with the Soul of Chriſt alone; nor is our fleſh alone joyned with the fleſh of Chriſt alone; but the whole Perſon of every Believer is truly joyned with the whole Perſon of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. On the one hand, the whole Perſon of Chriſt is united to the Believer; the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers union with Chriſt, is neither with the Divine nor Humane Nature conſidered apart; but it is with the whole Perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of both Natures; and indeed, elſe they could not be ſaid to be united to [Chriſt], for neither of the Natures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered apart, is Chriſt: We cannot ſay, that the Divine Nature is Chriſt, or that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature is Chriſt; but Chriſt is both the Divine and Humane Nature, God-man, in one Perſon.<note place="margin">Buchan. Inſtitut. Theol.loc. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith a Learned Man) <hi>is not a Name of either Nature, but of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conſiſting of both Natures, together with his Office.</hi> Beſides, were we united only to one Nature, and not to the whole Perſon of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94533:10"/>Chriſt, what would our Union avail us? Surely it would be vain and ineffectual. Were we united to the Humane Nature only, and not to the Divine, then to be ſure our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be ineffectual; For Chriſt himſelf tells us, <hi>That it is the Spirit which quickeneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> John 6.63. That is (as judicious Interpreters expound it) the fleſh or Humane Nature of Chriſt conſidered alone, and without the influence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, availeth nothing to Souls as to their ſpiritual or eternal good: Nor indeed, can the Humane Nature of Chriſt, without the Divine, give Grace, or any ſpiritual good thing. On the other hand, were we united to the Divine Nature alone, and not to the Humane, then our Union would be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual: for how full ſoever the Divine Nature is of Grace and Life in it ſelf, yet nothing can thence be derived and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to us, but by and through the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: And indeed, as the Humanity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing without the Divinity; ſo I may ſay, the Divinity will profit us nothing without the Humanity. Hence it is, that Chriſt ſo often ſpeaks of <hi>eating his Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>drinking his Blood,</hi> and withal aſſerts the neceſſity thereof in order to life and happineſs by him, <hi>John</hi> 6.53, 54, 55. What doth <hi>eating his Fleſh and drinking his Blood</hi> ſignifie, but an Union with his Humanity? And therefore in <hi>verſ.</hi> 56. he addeth, <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him;</hi> which is an
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94533:10"/>expreſſion of Union; and without this we have, we can have no Life, no Grace from him. In a word, as the humanity hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give or communicate to us, no Life, no Grace, no Spiritual Bleſſing without the Divinity; ſo the Divinity is incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us without the Humanity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were our Union with the one only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, it muſt needs he ineffectual. I will cloſe this with the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an eminent Divine,<note place="margin">Etſi tota ſalus &amp; vita a Deitatis plenitudine pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det quae eſt in Chriſto, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim tamen nobis non communicatur niſi in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne &amp; per carnem Chriſti: Deitas enim eſt ceu fons unde fluunt omnia bona, vita, &amp; ſalus, ſed caro at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que humanitas eſt ceu ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis per quem ad nos deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantur omnia haec bona omneſque gratiae, niſi quis igitur canalem hunc ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendat, eique uniatur, aquarum certè, quae è fonte profluunt, particeps fieri non poteſt. <hi>Zanch.</hi> in Thes: de connubio Spirituali.</note> 
                  <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all Life, all Salvation floweth from the fulneſs of the Deity that is in Chriſt, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to us but in the fleſh, and by the fleſh of Chriſt. For the Deity is as the Fountain whence all good things flow, Life and Salvation; but the fleſh, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, is as the Channel, by which all theſe good things, and all Gifts and Graees are derived unto us; therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a man apprehendeth this Channel, and be united to it, he cannot poſſibly be made a partaker of theſe Waters which do flow from this Fountain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. On the other hand, the whole Perſon of the Believer is united to Chriſt; not his Soul onely without his Body, nor yet his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy onely without his Soul, but his whole Perſon conſiſting of both Soul and Body in conjunction: As Chriſt is the Saviour, ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94533:11"/>he is the Head of the whole Perſon of every Believer, for he ſaves none but thoſe whom he is a Head unto: And as Chriſt is the Head of, ſo he muſt have union with the whole Perſon of every Believer; for his being an Head implies union, and that union muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as far as his Headſhip doth, even to the whole Perſon: In ſhort, the Believers Soul is united to Chriſt, therefore ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit;</hi> and the Believers Body is united to Chriſt, and therefore the Bodies of Believers are ſaid to be <hi>Members of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.15. thus this union is a full union: And as it is a full, ſo it is a very near union. Next to thoſe two great Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the eſſential Union, the Union of the three Perſons in One, and the ſame Divine Eſſence, and the Perſonal Union, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the two Natures, Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, in the Perſon of Chriſt; this is the neareſt Union. Hence it is expreſſed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by their <hi>being in each other,</hi> John 14.20. <hi>Ye ſhall know, that I am in the Father, and ye in me, and I in you:</hi> ſometimes by their <hi>dwelling in each other;</hi> John 6.56. <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> And what can be nearer, than to be and dwell in each other? It is a nearer Union than that between the Husband and the Wife, for that Union may be broken, and is at laſt, but this never is, never can be broken, (as in its place will be ſhewn).</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94533:11"/>III. This Eſpouſal, or Marriage-relation between Chriſt and Believers, carries in it full and laſting communion: In Marriage-relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there is a full and free communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parties, both in what they are, and what they have: The Husband admits the ſife into a participation in all he is and hath; on the other hand, he communicates with her in all ſhe is and hath; and indeed union is in order to communion: So here, in the Eſpouſal or Marriage-relation between Chriſt and Believers, there is a full and free communion between them in all they are and have. On the one hand, Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates himſelf unto the Believer, he admits him into a fellowſhip and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him in all his riches and fulneſs; hence is, that <hi>John</hi> 1.16. <hi>of his fullneſs have all we received, and that Grace for Grace:</hi> verſ. 14. He is ſaid to be <hi>full of Grace:</hi> And what Grace is that? Why all Grace, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Grace, Purchaſed Grace, Grace of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and Grace of Influence: And here it is ſaid, that <hi>of his fulneſs have all we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;</hi> not <hi>ſome</hi> onely, but <hi>all,</hi> great and ſmall <hi>have received,</hi> and that not in a low, poor, ſcanty meaſure onely,<note place="margin">Gratiam ſuper gratiam <hi>h. e.</hi> accumulat iſſimam &amp; copioſiſſimam, omnem gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, nempe juſtitiam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionem peccatorum, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitatem, renovationem ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus, &amp;c. <hi>Glaſ.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94533:12"/>Sanctification, Renovation of the Spirit, and the like. Look what-ever Chriſt is, or hath, which Believers are capable of, it is all theirs, and they all hold communion with him therein: His beauty is theirs; and how black and deformed ſoever they are in themſelves, yet they are fair and comely in him:<note place="margin">Nigra per naturam, formoſa per grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> Hence ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>I am black, but comely,</hi> Cant. 1.5. that is, black in my ſelf, but comely in Chriſt; black by Nature, but comely by the Redeemers Grace, <hi>comely through the comelineſs which he puts upon me,</hi> Ezek. 16.14. His Righteouſneſs is theirs; and how guilty and unrighteous ſoever they are in themſelves, yet in him they are Righteous, and do ſtand perfectly righteous in the ſight of God: Hence his Name is ſaid to be, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs, Jer.</hi> 23.6. and they are ſaid to be made <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. His Priviledges and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities are theirs; and how vile and baſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are in themſelves; yet in him they are highly dignified and advanced. Is he a Son? ſo are they through him: <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God, to as many as believed in his Name,</hi> John 1.12. Is he an Heir, an Heir of God? ſo are they, they are Heirs, yea <hi>coheirs with him of God,</hi> Rom. 8.17. Is he beloved by the Father, and that with a choice and ſingular love? ſo are they, they are beloved in him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. yea, they are beloved with the ſame love, wherewith he is beloved by the Father, <hi>John</hi> 17.23. Is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94533:12"/>he a King? ſo are they, he hath made them, and doth make them all Kings, and they do, and ſhall reign with him for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6.<note place="margin">In Chriſte beatam immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem &amp; gloriam poſſidemus. <hi>Calv. in loc.</hi>

                  </note> And what then? why it follows, <hi>and ye are compleat in him,</hi> q.d. You are poor and empty things in your ſelves, but your Head and Husband hath all the fulneſs of the God-head in him, and it is alwayes in him; for it dwelleth in him; and it is all yours, and you do communicate with him in all, ſo far as you are capable of it, to compleat you both in Grace and Glory. Thus Chriſt communicates himſelf unto the Believer, and admits him into a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94533:13"/>with him in all he is and hath.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, Chriſt partakes and holds communion with Believers in all they are and have: And what is their All? truly a poor All; in and of themſelves, they have nothing but ſins and ſorrows, guilt and afflictions. Indeed in marrying of them, he gives them Gifts, Graces, Comforts, and the like: and having given them theſe, he holds communion with them in all: their Gifts and Graces, their Joys and Comforts are his: but, I ſay, in and of themſelves they have nothing but ſorrows and ſins, and he in a ſort holdeth communion with them in both: he holds communion with them in their ſorrows; hence it is ſaid, that <hi>in all their afflictions he is afflicted,</hi> Iſa. 63.9. He looks upon their ſorrows as his, and their ſufferings as his. <hi>I was an hungry, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirſty, naked, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35, 36. And often (you know) in Scripture, their Sufferings and Afflictions, are called the Sufferings and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of Chriſt: And why the Sufferings and Afflictions of Chriſt? not onely becauſe for the moſt part they ſuffer for his ſake; but alſo becauſe he ſuffereth and is afflicted in them,<note n="*" place="margin">Chriſtus nominat ſuas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitates, quia ſenſit in ſe tranſlata eſſe peccata om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium noſtrſim, ſeque propter haec plecti, non aliter ac ſi ipſe ſe mois, tuis, &amp; omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um hominum ſcaeleribus polluiſſet. <hi>Mol.</hi>
                  </note> and with them: He communicates with them in their afflictions: And, as in their ſorrows, ſo alſo in ſome ſort in their ſius too: Hence he calls their ſins, as well as their afflictions, his.

                  <hi>The like ſweet Names are not to be found, by which the ſweet Affections of Chriſt and the Soul are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed each to other, as thoſe of the Bridegroom and the Bride, for why, all things are common with thent, nothing proper, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing ſeparate and apart each from other; they have both one Inheritance, one Houſe, one Table, one Marriage-bed, alſo one fleſh:</hi> The ſum is, they communicate with each other in all they are and have.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This Eſpouſal, or Marriage-relation between Chriſt and Believers, carries in it ſtrong and ardent Affection. In a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-relation, there is the deareſt, ſtrongeſt,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94533:14"/>and moſt intimate Affection that is to be found among the Children of Men: 'Tis a Relation made up of love: Love is not only a concomitant of Marriage, but it is even a part of it, and is eſſential to it: In Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Hearts muſt be joyned as well as Hands, or they are not right: So here in this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-eſpouſal, or Marriage-relation between Chriſt and Believers, there is a very dear and intimate Affection each to other; their hearts are indeed knit, and do intimately cleave to one another: <hi>The Saints</hi> (ſayes one) <hi>are called the Spouſe of Chriſt, Propter amoris magnitudinem;</hi> becauſe of that great and unparallel'd love that is between them. And it is a ſweet ſaying, which I have read in one of the Antients to this purpoſe.<note place="margin">Chriſtus ſe ſponſum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum appellat, ut magni tudinem inſinuet ſui amc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru, qui tempore non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcit amicam ſuam ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam non uxcrem, eo quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illius amer, ſemper novus ſt. <hi>Bern. de paſſ.

                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>calls himſelf our. Bridegroom, that he might inſinuate the greatneſs of his love to us, which decayes not with time; and he calls us his Spouſe, not his Wife, noting that our love to him ſhould be alwayes new, alwayes lively and vigorous.</hi> The truth is, no love like that between Chriſt and his Spouſe; Chriſt loves and eſpouſes, and the Soul loves and is eſpouſed; and both being eſpouſed, do love for ever; and ſo this relation is both founded in love, and perfected in love; 'tis both made up and managed with love on all hands; Chriſt ſets his love upon the Soul, and in that love eſpouſes him to himſelf; and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94533:14"/>having in this love of his eſpouſed him to himſelf, then he loves him as his Spouſe: of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> his Spouſe is called his Love; as alſo he on the other hand is called her Beloved: and what doth this note, but that the whole relation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts mainly in love, and that they are moſt dearly and intimately beloved by each other? Chriſt having eſpouſed the Soul to himſelf, now his love runs out in full ſtreams towards him; he loves him above all the reſt of the Creatures, in ſome reſpects above the Angels themſelves, as ſtanding in a nearer relation to him than they do. On the other hand, the Souls love is drawn out to Chriſt, and loving him, he is eſpouſed to him, and being eſpouſed to him, he loves him yet more; now <hi>Chriſt is laid between his breaſts,</hi> in his moſt intimate Affections, he has the Throne in his heart, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.13. yea the Soul by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees comes to be <hi>ſick of love</hi> to him, (as you have it) <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Stay me with Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,</hi> (ſayes ſhe) <hi>comfort me with Apples, for I am ſick of love;</hi> to whom? to Chriſt: And truly this (as one of the Antients hath obſerved) <hi>is a ſweet ſickneſs, a bleſſed lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor,</hi>

                  <hi>a pleaſant love:</hi> And this love between Chriſt and his Spouſe, is a chaſt love, a Virgin love, a love that is pitched upon the perſon of each other; Chriſt loves the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Believer, and the Believer loves the Perſon of Chriſt.

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94533:15"/>V. This Eſpouſal, or Marriage-relation between Chriſt and Believers, carries in it a mutual reſt and complacency for ever. In a Marriage-relation, there is great delight and complacency the Parties have, or ſhould have each in other, eſpecially in the day of Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals. You know how <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with the Wife of thy Youth: let her be as the loving Hind and pleaſant Roe: let her Breaſts ſatisfie thee at all times, and be thou raviſhed alwayes with her love,</hi> Prov. 5.18, 19. All noting that joy, reſt, and complacency, that that relation carries in it, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have in each other; and we read (you know) of the joy of the Bridegroom, as the higheſt and pureſt that is found among the Sons of men:<note place="margin">Non ille aliam velit ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, nec ego amicum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um: uterqe alterius a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore contentus eſt. <hi>Merc</hi> in Cant. <hi>2.16.</hi>
                  </note> So in this ſpiritual Eſpouſals between Chriſt and Believers, there is a mutual reſt and complacency which they have in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: They are, as it were, the reſt, the joy, the ſatisfaction of each other; the ſolace of each others Soul. On the one hand, Chriſt reſts and rejoyces in the Believer, as one would do in the Wife of his Youth: This his Spouſe is to him, <hi>as a loving Hind, and pleaſant Roe,</hi> and he lives joyfully with her: hence ſhe is called his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and that as being married to him: <hi>Thou ſhalt be called</hi> Hephzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah,<note place="margin">Vecaberis <hi>Chephziba,</hi> h. e. ita exornata &amp; amaena e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, ut volupt as mea in te futura ſt. <hi>Glaſ.

And again, <hi>As a young man marryeth a Virgin, ſo ſhall thy Sons marry thee; and as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee,</hi> verſ. 5. The ſum of all which amounts to this, That Chriſt marrying his People to himſelf, delights in them, and rejoyces over them, and that with the higheſt and pureſt delight and complacency of all others, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and complacency ſutable to the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The truth is, he ſpeaks as if all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light were in them, as if he had forgotten to delight in the Angels, or in any of the works of his hands, but in them alone. <hi>My goodneſs</hi> (ſayes he to the Father) <hi>extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints, in whom is all my delight,</hi> Pſalm 16.2. Yea, he declares himſelf raviſhed with them, as his Spouſe; Cant. 4.9. <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my Siſter my Spouſe; thou haſt raviſhed my heart:</hi> And he ſpeaks as one raviſhed indeed. <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.6. <hi>How fair and pleaſant art thou, O Love, for delight!</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 5. he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges himſelf captivated by her, <hi>Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me:</hi> Yea, he has declared them to be his Reſt, Pſal. 132.14. <hi>This is my reſt for ever,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>here will I dwell, for I have deſired it:</hi> It's ſpoken of <hi>Zion,</hi> as a Type of the Church, and Spouſe of Chriſt, and his reſt in her; and indeed they are his Reſt, his Soul is at reſt in them, in them is his higheſt joy: Hence that ſweet word, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The Lord thy God, in the midſt of thee is mighty;</hi>

On the other hand, the Believer reſts and rejoyces in Chriſt, as in his Head and Husband: <hi>I ſat down under his ſhadow</hi> (ſayes the Spouſe) <hi>with great delight,</hi> Cant. 2.3. She did <hi>ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viter requieſcere</hi> (as one expreſſes it) ſweetly reſt, and repoſe her Soul in him: Her Soul was at reſt, and filled with delight, great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ſhe had great ſpringings of joy within her, and all this in Chriſt her Bridegroom; in his Perſon, in his Preſence, in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, in the fruits of his Grace and Love: And therefore it follows, <hi>and his Fruit was ſweet to my taſte;</hi> as if ſhe ſhould ſay, O with what joy, what ſolace, what delight and ſatisfaction of Soul did I converſe with him, and feed upon him!

               <p>HAving ſeen ſomewhat of the nature of the Eſpouſal or Marriage-relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and Believers, the next thing to be enquired into is, How this Eſpouſal or Relation is made up and accompliſhed: To be ſure, naturally we are all ſtrangers to it, and unacquainted with it, being (as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out union with him, or any ſpiritual Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12.

               <p n="1">I. This Eſpouſal or Marriage-relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and Believers, flows from the Riches of Divine Grace, as its onely Spring and Fountain: that any of the Sons of Men are Married or Eſpouſed to Chriſt, is not from any thing of worth or deſervings in them, but purely and entirely from free Grace and Love dwelling and working in the heart of God and Chriſt towards them; and this account the Scripture gives us of it, Jer. 31.3. <hi>I have loved thee with in everlaſting, love; therefore with loving kindneſſ have I deawn thee:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I have drawn thee out of thy ſins, out of thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, out of all thy carnal reſts and refuges, and I have drawn thee to my ſelf, into uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion with my ſelf, into a Marriage-covenant and Relation with my, ſelf; and all this from mine own free love, that love, that kindneſs, that has been in my heart towards thee from everlaſting: So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in loving, kindneſs, and in mercies.</hi> Mark, It is mercy and loving kindneſs, which eſpouſes Souls to Chriſt.<note n="*" place="margin">Deſpenſat nos Deus Chriſto nallis noſtris meritis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis biss, ſed ex ſua tantum bonitate &amp; miſericordia. <hi>Zanch.</hi>

                  <hi>God</hi> (ſayes one upon this place) <hi>eſpouſes us to Chriſt, indu ed thereunto by no merits of ours,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94533:20"/>but by his own goodneſſ and mercy.</hi> And indeed, my Beloved, what have we, or what have any of the ſons of men, that ſhould ſpeak the one or the other worthy of a conjugal-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſt, or that ſhould invite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to take us into ſuch a relation to himſelf? Have we Birth or Parentage to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him? No, alas! as to our ſtate, we are all of the brood of Hell, and thence, as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, we all have our deſcent and original, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. Have we beauty and arniable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? No, for we are all black and deformed in our ſelves, we have the ſpirit of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in us, and the image of the Devil upon us: we are blind, and deaf, and dumb, and lame, and crooked: ſo the Scripture ſpeaks of us in our natural ſtate, we are all <hi>in our blood</hi> and gore, <hi>caſt out into the open field to the loathing of our perſons,</hi> Ezek. 16.5, 6.

Treaſures, it is true, we have, but they are black ones; treaſures of ſin and wickedneſs, treaſures of guilt and wrath, which ſurely cannot render us worthy, but moſt unworthy of ſuch a Relation.

We are enemies to his Perſon, to his Kingdom, to his Grace, to his Righteouſneſs, to his Wayes, and to all acquaintance and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him: Thus we have nothing to induce him to take us into ſuch a Relation: at the beſt, we are but poor <hi>worms, whoſe Foundation is in the duſt:</hi> And what can it be, but free and rich Grace in Chriſt to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and eſpouſe ſuch unto himſelf?</p>
               <p n="2">II. This Eſpouſal or Marriage-relation between Chriſt and Believers, is wrought and effected by the Power of Divine Grace, as its principle and efficient: When Souls are married and eſpouſed to Chriſt, 'tis not done by any power or ability of their own, nor
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94533:21"/>yet by the power and efficacy of means and inſtruments, but 'tis purely from the power and efficacy of Divine Grace: Indeed, God makes uſe of Means and Inſtruments, he makes uſe of the Goſpel and Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for the eſpouſing of ſinners to his Son, and theſe are the onely ordinary way and means whereby he doth it; therefore ſayes the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in my Text, <hi>[I] have eſpouſed you to one Husband;</hi> that is, I by my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, I by preaching the everlaſting Goſpel, have been an Inſtrument in God's hand for your eſpouſing to Chriſt: but though God thus makes uſe of means and inſtruments in this Work, yet ſtill the Work it ſelf is from pure Grace, and to Grace doth Chriſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it, excluding all other power but this as ſufficient hereunto, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me,</hi> or believe on me, cloſe with me in a Marriage-Covenant, <hi>except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath ſent me, draw him:</hi> that is, except the power of Divine Grace be put forth upon him in order hereunto: the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here Chriſt ſpeaks of, is comprehenſive of the whole buſineſs; it's the enabling of us to come to Chriſt, to believe on him, and cloſe with him as our Head and Husband.<note place="margin">Non violenta coactio ſad voluntatis a Deo averſae benevola flexio, tractione ea innuitur. <hi>Glaſ.

                  </note> It notes (as one obſerves) not any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent coaction or conſtraint, but a ſweet bowing of the Will, which in it ſelf was averſe from, and oppoſite to God and Chriſt; and withal, a carrying of the Soul to Chriſt, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94533:22"/>an enabling of him to cloſe with him in this Relation: and this Chriſt aſcribes whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the power of Divine Grace: the truth is, in and of our ſelves we have no power or ability for ſuch a work; we are <hi>without ſtrength,</hi> Rom. 6.5. Yea, when we are brought into Chriſt by the power of Divine Grace; yet then, in and of our ſelves, <hi>we can do nothing;</hi> So Chriſt tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> Yea, when we are brought into Chriſt, and have had ſome communion with him; yet we can't follow after him, nor draw one tittle nearer to him, unleſs a freſh influence of Divine Grace be put forth upon us, enabling us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; ſo much the Spouſe was ſenſible of, and therefore prayes thus, <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1.4. As if ſhe ſhould ſay, Lord in my ſelf I can't ſtir one foot towards thee; but do thou put forth thy Power in drawing of me, and then, and not till then, ſhall I come nearer to thee: Yea, my Beloved, the eſpouſing of Souls to Chriſt, is not only the Act or Work of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, and the power of it; But 'tis the Act or Work of the mighty Power of that Grace; 'tis not an ordinary power that is and muſt be put forth therein, but even the greatneſs of the power of that Grace, a power no leſs than that which was put forth <hi>in raiſing Chriſt form the dead:</hi> So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20. <hi>That you may know</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward, who believe,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94533:22"/>according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead.</hi> So then here is power, mighty power, the mighty power of God, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the mighty power of God, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatneſs of the mighty power of God, the ſame exceeding greatneſs of the mighty power of God which raiſed Chriſt from the dead; and all put forth to enable us to believe, and ſo to cloſe with Chriſt in a Marriage-Covenant. Thus this Work is every way from Divine Grace. But here more particularly, the enquiry will be, What thoſe Acts or Works of Divine Grace are, by which poor ſinners come to be eſpouſed to Chriſt? I ſhall reduce them all to two Heads; they are either, (firſt) more remote, being Acts of Divine Grace put forth for us and towards us; or (ſecondly) more near, being Acts of Divine Grace put forth in us and upon us: In the firſt, the Father and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt work more immediately by and from themſelves: In the ſecond, they work by the influence and miniſtry of the Bleſſed Spirit: I'le ſpeak a little of each.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Wherein are contained the more remote Acts of Divine Grace, put forth more immediately by the Father and Jeſus Chriſt, for us and towards us, in order to the accompliſhment of the Eſpouſal between Chriſt and us.</head>
               <p>THere are ſome more remote Acts of Grace, Acts of Grace put forth more immediately by the Father and Jeſus Chriſt, for us, and towards us, in order to the making up of this Eſpouſal or Marriage-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between Chriſt and us; and of theſe I ſhall mention five, all which do neceſſarily concur, and have their influence into this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and indeed there is much of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God in them: They are thoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">I. God the Father marries and eſpouſes our Nature to the Perſon of his Son, and thereby ſits and prepares him to be an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for us; this God has done once for all, and the influence thereof concurs unto the accompliſhment of the Eſpouſal between Chriſt and every Believer. I ſhall illuſtrate this unto you, from that Parable <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>beg.</hi> where we read of <hi>a King who made a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94533:23"/>marriage for his Son;</hi> by which King we are to underſtand God the Father; and by his Son, Jeſus Chriſt, the Eternal Son of that Eternal Father, He, who proceeded from him by eternal generation: God the Father then is here ſaid to make a marriage for his Son: But, pray, who is the Spouſe? 'tis obſerved by Divines, that the Spouſe is not here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: Who or what then is ſhe? 'tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Chriſt has a two-fold Spouſe; our Nature, and the perſons of Believers: Both which may be intended here, though the firſt chiefly and principally; and ſo by the Marriage here we are to underſtand the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Marriage, the Marriage between the Perſon of the Son of God and our Nature:<note place="margin">Per nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum in carnatum <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                  </note> and ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> and others expound it: This primarily, but ſecondarily, &amp; by conſequence, the Spiritual Marriage, the Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and Believers; and we are to look on the one as laying a foundation and making way for the other: So that the whole reſolves into this, that God the Father hath married and eſpouſed our Nature to the Perſon of his Son in the hypoſtatical union, and thereby has fitted and prepared him to be an Husband for us; and made way for the marriage of our perſons to his Perſon in the Spiritual Union: And indeed, unleſs our Nature had been firſt married to him in the one, our perſons could never poſſibly have been married to him in the other; for pray obſerve, the glory of Chriſt conſidered as the Eternal Son, and ſo as God, is too bright,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94533:24"/>and the diſtance between him and us too great for us to come to him, and he made one with him in a Marriage-relation: Chriſt conſidered in his own naked glory, as God, is too bright an Object for us to look upon, much more to have ſo near an union to, and communion with; one ſight of him thus conſidered, is enough to ſwallow us up, and even to overwhelm our Spirits; We cannot thus ſee him and live: But now our Nature being married and eſpouſed to his Divine Perſon; that is to ſay, he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſumed our Nature into union with himſelf, as the eternal Son, which the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt</hi> calls his being <hi>made fleſh,</hi> John 1.14. And the Apoſtle, <hi>his partaking of fleſh and blood,</hi> Heb. 2.14. Hereby the overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brightneſs of his Glory is vailed, and the dreadful terror of his greatneſs, together with the affrighting diſtance between him and us is taken away: Yea, hereby his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is brought down (as one hath it) to our eye, to our beholding: Hereby he has mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly ſweetned and endeared himſelf to us, and made way for us for a free acceſs to him, and the neareſt union and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him: Hence Divines give this as one reaſon of Chriſts incarnation, that he might thereby become a fit Husband for his People, and they might be capable of union and communion with him:<note n="*" place="margin">Hac de cauſâ Filius Dei factus eſt homo ut poſſet verus eſſe ſponſus Eccleſiae.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore</hi> (as a Learned Man has obſerved) <hi>was the Son of God made Man, that he might
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94533:24"/>be a true, a fit Bridegroom for the Church,</hi> and 'tis rightly obſerved by Divines, that in ſtrict propriety of ſpeech, neither the Father, nor the Holy Spirit, but the Son, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, is the Churches Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom; and they give this reaſon for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he only was made Man, he only was incarnate, O, had not the Son of God been incarnate, had he not (as <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s expreſſion is) <hi>married our Nature to himſelf in the Womb of the Virgin,</hi> none of us had ever been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch a priviledge, ſuch an happineſs, as a conjugal-union and communion with him. That therefore is the firſt Act of Grace in this buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">II. God the Father gives Chriſt unto the Soul, and the Soul to Chriſt; he gives Chriſt for an Head and Husband to the Soul, and he gives the Soul for a Bride or Spouſe to Chriſt. (Firſt) He gives Chriſt for an Head and Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to the Soul, in <hi>John</hi> 4.10. Chriſt is called <hi>the Gift of God:</hi> And how the Gift of God? two wayes, (1ſt) in that he gave him for us; he gave him to be incarnate, to ſuffer, to bleed, to dye, to be made ſin and a curſe for us; he gave him as an Offering and a Sacrifice for us; and (ſecondly) in that he gives him alſo to us, he gives him to be an Head and Husband to us: Hence 'tis ſaid, That <hi>he gave him to be Head to the Church,</hi> and ſuch an Head as has the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and diſpoſe of all things; <hi>He gave him to be Head over all things to the Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:94533:25"/>Epheſ. 1.22. both in the Counſel of his Will from Eternity, and alſo in the Act or Worlt of his Grace here in Time, he thus gives Chriſt to us: And O how richly and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly doth his Grace ſhine forth herein! In giving Chriſt to us, he gives his beſt and his deareſt; for he has nothing better, nothing dearer to him than his Chriſt, (as afterwards may be ſhewn). (Secondly) He gives the Soul for a Bride or Spouſe to Chriſt: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers (you know) are often ſaid to be given by the Father to Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which gave them me</hi> (ſayes Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Believers) <hi>is greater than all,</hi> Joh. 10.29. And <hi>thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me,</hi> Joh. 17.6. with many other places which might be mentioned. God gives all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to Chriſt to be his Spouſe; he gives them to him (firſt) in the eternal purpoſe and counſel of his Grace; in the day of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love, when God firſt ſet his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his choſen on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, then gave he them to his Son, and will'd their union to him in a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Covenant; and he gives them to him alſo (ſecondly) in the work of Vocation, which makes way for the working of Faith in Chriſt in the Soul.<note place="margin">Fater hanc <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>The Father</hi> (ſayes one) <hi>hath given this Spouſe to his Son,</hi> (ſpeaking of his Church) <hi>and joyns her to him by his Spirit.</hi> And, my Beloved, without this Act of Grace put forth by God towards us, the Match would never be made between Chriſt and any poor Soul; for this indeed is that which brings the Soul to Chriſt: So much
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94533:25"/>Chriſt himſelf tells us, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me.</hi> Mark, 'tis the Fathers giving us to Chriſt, that brings us to him; and were we not by the Father given to him, we ſhould never come to him by believing; and if we never came to him by believing, there could never be a Marriage-union and relation between him and us.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Chriſt readily approves and accepts of the Fathers Gift, being willing, yea longingly deſirous to eſpouſe them unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whom his Father gives him in order thereunto. In the making up of a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, 'tis not enough that the Father gives ſuch or ſuch an one to his Son, and his Son to her; but there muſt alſo be the conſent of the Son; he muſt approve and accept of the Fathers Gift; and ſo does Chriſt here, he approves and accepts of the Fathers Gift: the Father wills his taking ſuch and ſuch poor ſinners to Wife, and accordingly gives him to them, and them to him, and the Will of Chriſt falls in with, and is conformed to the Will of the Father herein, and ſo the Match goes on: this you have clearly held forth, John 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given me, cometh unto me; and him that cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Mark, Here are among others, two things. 1. Here is the Fathers giving of poor ſinners to Chriſt, and therein his will and conſent that they ſhould be eſpouſed to him; that in theſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94533:26"/>words, <hi>All that the Father hath given me.</hi> 2. Here is Chriſts approbation and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Giſt of the Father, with his will and conſent to eſpouſe them to himſelf; that in theſe words, <hi>And him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out;</hi> that is, I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly receive him, and accept of him; I will take him into a conjugal union and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to my ſelf. Chriſt here plainly declares his acceptance of the Father's Gift, giving poor ſinners to him to be his Spouſes. 'Tis a great Saying, and ſutable to this I am ſpeaking, which I have read in a great Divine,<note place="margin">Praecedit aeterna Dei vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas, Chriſtus vero ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us non poteſt non velle, quod vult Pater: ideo nos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ccipit, ut ſponſam ſuam.</note> 
                  <hi>The eternal will and good pleaſure of God precedes</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>but Chriſt the Bridegroom cannot but will the ſame thing which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wills; his Will is conformed to the Fathers, and therefore does he accept us as his Spouſe.</hi> In a word, in this Act of Grace, Chriſt's Language is ſuch as this; Father, doſt thou give ſuch and ſuch poor ſinners to me? and is it thy Will, that they ſhould be eſpouſed to me? Content; I do freely accept of them, and am willing to eſpouſe them to my ſelf for ever: 'tis true, they are poor worthleſs Creatures, altogether unſutable to my dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and greatneſs; but Father they are thy Gift, and I accept of them as ſuch: true, there is no beauty in them that I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them, but they are thy Gift, and I will marry them and make them beautiful: and Oh what Grace is this!</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:94533:26"/>IV. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt not onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves and accepts of the Fathers Gift, but moreover he redeems them thus given to him with the price of his own Blood; he ranſoms them from Sin, and Death, and Hell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in themſelves they were all in bondage, which alſo neceſſarily concurs to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the eſpouſal between him and them. 'Tis obſerved by ſome, that in the Eaſtern Countries, it was the manner for men to buy their Wives; and indeed ſo much ſeems to be intimated in that Meſſage of <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 18.25. where when he would perſwade <hi>David</hi> to marry his Daughter, in pretence at leaſt, he ſends him word, that he deſired not any Dowry, but ſo and ſo: It ſeems then, that it was uſual to expect a Dowry. The ſame alſo appears by the practice of <hi>Shechem,</hi> Gen. 34.11, 12. where being in love with <hi>Dinah, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> Daughter, he profered to give a Dowry for her; <hi>Give me</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>but thy Damoſel to Wife, and ask me never ſo much Dowry and Gift, and I will give it thee.</hi> To be ſure ſo 'tis here, Chriſt buyes all his Spouſes, and gives a vaſt Gift for them; Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is in love with poor ſinners, given him by the Father, and deſires to marry them to himſelf; but he muſt buy them if he means to have them, and buy them he does, and at a dear rate; he gives a great Dowry for them, even his Life, his Blood, his Glory, and all for a time: Hence he is ſaid <hi>to give himſelf for us,</hi> Epheſ. 5.25. and to <hi>purchaſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94533:27"/>us by his Blood,</hi> Acts 20.28. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e we are ſaid to be <hi>bought by him with a price,</hi> with a great price, a price of ineſtimable value, even <hi>his own moſt precious Blood,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. The caſe lies thus, the Elect, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were all gone into captivity, ſold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin and Satan, in bondage to Death, and Hell, and Wrath, which is the condition of all by Nature; and if Chriſt will have them as his Spouſe, he muſt ranſom and redeem them from all; which accordingly he does: he bleeds, he dies, <hi>he gives himſelf a ranſom</hi> for them, in order to the marrying of them to himſelf: He had indeed a mind to a Spouſe among the Children of Men, and was in love with them from all eternity, as he himſelf tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31. and ſo in love with them, as that he does in effect ſay unto the Father, as <hi>Schechem</hi> did to <hi>Jacob, Ask me never ſo much Dowry, and I will give it.</hi> Why, my Son, ſayes the Father, if thou wilt have them, and marry them to thy ſelf, thou muſt give thy Blood, thy Life for them; thou muſt redeem them from Sin, and Death, and Hell, whereunto they are in bondage; which can't be done by leſs than thy giving thy ſelf a ranſom for them: all which Chriſt aſſents unto, and complies with, and that with delight, freely giving himſelf for them. And oh what Grace is this! Oh to give ſuch a price for ſuch a Spouſe! a price ſo great, for a Spouſe ſo black and unworthy; this is glorious Grace indeed!</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:94533:27"/>V. Chriſt makes love to them, tenders himſelf unto their embraces, and withal wooeth them for their acceptance of him, and that with the greateſt and moſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate importunity: How much ſoever it has coſt Chriſt to redeem poor ſinners, and how great a Dowry ſoever he has given for them, yet they are unwilling to cloſe with him, they have no mind, no heart Chriſtward, and ſo the Match is not like to be made up unleſs ſomething further be done; therefore after all, Chriſt (as one phraſes it) comes a wooing to them, he makes love, offering himſelf to them, and earneſtly follicites them for their love and acceptance: he importunes them, and that in ſuch a way, as if he were reſolved to take no denyal; in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. we read of a <hi>time of love,</hi> a time (that is) of Chriſt's making love to ſinners lying in their blood and gore. And indeed, Chriſt has his times of love, times when he makes love, and offers himſelf with all his Riches and Treaſures to poor ſinners: when his language to them is, <hi>Behold me, behold me;</hi> Iſa. 65.1. and <hi>look unto me, and be ye ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all ye ends of the earth,</hi> Iſa. 45.22. Now he comes, and tells over the ſtories of his love to them, how much he has done and ſuffered for them, how much his deſire is towards them, what great things he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llow upon them, and inſtate them into, and all to win and allure them to himſelf, to gain their love and conſent to accept of him, and to be his in a Marriage Covenant. Time
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94533:28"/>was when Chriſt came and did this himſelf in perſon; when he <hi>ſtood, and cryed, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drink,</hi> John 7.37. Time was, when in his own Perſon he importuned poor ſinners from day to day, he made love to them time after time, as he did (you know) to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Matth. 23.37. for ſome years together he woo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d them, and offered himſelf and his grace to them in his own perſon; and though he does not now come in perſon, yet as <hi>David</hi> ſent his Servants to <hi>Abigail, to commune with her,</hi> and to acquaint her with his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and deſire to <hi>take her to Wife,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.39. ſo Chriſt ſends us his Servants, his Miniſters to poor ſinners to commune with them, and to declare the love and purpoſes of his heart towards them, and to woo them for him; yea, and as <hi>Ambaſſadors for Chriſt,</hi> we do woo poor Souls; and <hi>as in Chriſt's ſtead, beſeech them to be reconciled to God,</hi> to give up their Names and Souls to Chriſt in a Marriage-Covenant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. And becauſe we can prevail nothing by and of our ſelves upon the ſpirits of men in this great Matter, Chriſt over and above, ſends his own bleſſed Spirit to woo them, and gain upon them, making them <hi>willing in the day of his power,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. And this leads me to the conſideration of thoſe other Acts of Grace in this buſineſs, wherein the Father and Jeſus Chriſt work by the Spirit in us and upon us, for the making up of the Match between Chriſt and us: Only, by the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94533:28"/>way, let us ſtill ſee and admire the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt to poor ſinners. O that he ſhould woo ſuch poor vile Creatures as we are, and make love to us! Should you ſee a King, a great King, wooing a Begger, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now himſelf in perſon, and then ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Servants to her to ſollicite and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune her love; you would look on this to be great Grace: but oh this is nothing to the Grace of Chriſt, in condeſcending to woo ſuch as we are, ſinners lying in our Blood.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Which gives an account of thoſe (which I call) more near Acts of Grace, which the Father and Jeſus Chriſt by the Spirit do put forth in us and upon us for the effecting of the Eſpouſals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and us.</head>
               <p>DIvine Grace has not yet done its work; no, there are other Acts which it does, and muſt put forth, if ever the Marriage be made up between Chriſt and us; and theſe I call more near, becauſe they are wrought in us and upon us, and do more immediately conduce to the tying of the Marriage-Knot between Chriſt and the Soul: And as in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94533:29"/>former, the Father and Jeſus Chriſt wrought more immediately of and by themſelves; ſo in theſe the bleſſed Spirits influence comes in, and his Grace ſhews its ſelf, they in theſe acting by him; and the truth is, the Match is all this while but half made: but now God comes, and by his Spirit working in and upon the Soul, carries on and compleats it; which he does by theſe five Acts of Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Soul is, by the Spirit of God, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from its old Husband, the Law, and thereby is fitted and prepared for an eſpouſal to Chriſt: Naturally we are all married to another Husband, even to the Law, and we muſt be divorced from that, or we can never be married and eſpouſed to Chriſt: So much the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> clearly holds forth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Wherefore, my Brethren, ye alſo are become dead to the Law by the Body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another, even to him who is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God.</hi> Pray mark, <hi>marryed to another;</hi> the Law then was their Husband, to which they were married, and that they muſt be dead to, and divorced from, if ever they would be married to Jeſus Chriſt. Look, ſayes he, (for 'tis his own Argument and Alluſion in <hi>verſ.</hi> 2 and 3) as a Woman can't be the Wife of two Husbands at once; but her preſent Husband muſt be dead before ſhe can be married to another; ſo neither can a Soul be eſpouſed to theſe two Husbands at
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94533:29"/>once, the Law and Chriſt, but he muſt be dead to, or divorced from the one, e're ho can be married to the other: Obſerve, <hi>ye are dead to the Law:</hi> What is it to be dead to the Law, or divorced from the Law? To be dead to the Law, is to have no hope, no expectation of Life and Righteouſneſs by the Law: 'tis to be ſenſible, that the Law cannot ſave us; yea, there is more in it than ſo, To be dead to the Law, is to ſee our ſelves dead by the Law; 'tis to ſee our ſelves loſt and condemned by the Law, for ſin as the tranſgreſſion thereof; and thus we muſt all be dead to the Law, or divorced from the Law, or we cannot be married to Chriſt. Now this the Spirit of God effects by a work of the Law upon the Conſcience: He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces the Soul from the Law by the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> by bringing home the Law to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: This the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> felt in his own Soul, <hi>I through the Law</hi> (ſayes he) that is, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God bringing home the Law to my Conſcience, <hi>am dead to the Law,</hi> Gal. 2.19, So again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>I was alive without the Law once, but when the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I dyed.</hi> I was alive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law once, that is, I thought my ſelf to be alive, I apprehended my ſtate to be good and happy; but this was without the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> before the Spirit of God, by the miniſtry of the Law, convinced me of my ſin and miſery; therefore it follows, when the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I dyed; <hi>i. e.</hi> when the Law came in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94533:30"/>power through the Spirit upon my Soul, then I ſaw my ſinful, dead, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſtate: thus was he himſelf divorced from the Law, that he might be married to Chriſt: the ſum is this, the Spirit of God comes and ſhews the Soul the ſtrictneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the purity and ſpirituality of the Law, and makes him ſenſible how large the Duty is that it requires; how impoſſible it is for him to keep it, and how many wayes he has broken it; he withal lets him ſee the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of that curſe and condemnation it has juſtly laid him under for the breach thereof; and thus he is divorced from it: and this is all one with the Spirits convincing us of ſin, and our loſt and miſerable condition by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof; which is (you know) his firſt work in order to Faith, and ſo to our eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. Thus by the Spirit of God the Soul is divorced from the Law, he is taken off from all expectations of life and happineſs by that, and is made to ſee his own ſinfulneſs, and ſo his infinite need of Chriſt, whereby he is fitted for this other and better Husband.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Soul being thus divorced from the Law, and ſo fitted and prepared for Chriſt, then the Spirit of God reveals and offers the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the promiſe of the Goſpel, as a better Husband to him: Now the bleſſed Spirit comes, and does as <hi>Abrahants</hi> Servant did, who was ſent to take a Wife for <hi>Iſaac;</hi> he told <hi>Rebecca of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94533:30"/>Greatneſs, of his Flocks, and his Herds; his Silver and his Gold, his men ſervants and his maid-ſervants,</hi> and withal, <hi>that he had given all to</hi> Iſaac, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.35, 36. So the Spirit of God now ſets before the Soul the riches and the greatneſs, the beauty and the excellency of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: he tells him, what a full, what a ſweet, what a rich, what an amiable one he is, and withal, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him to his embraces: he reveals and offers him to him, as one full of Grace and Truth, as one that has all fulneſs dwelling in him, all fulneſs of Life and Peace, or Righteouſneſs and Salvation: as one every way able to ſave him to the very utmoſt, which is that which Chriſt calls his <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the World of Righteouſneſs,</hi> John 16.9. he reveals and offers him to him in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent Beauty, Excellency, and Amiableneſs of his Perſon on the one hand; as alſo in the glorious fulneſs, largeneſs, &amp; ſufficiency of his Grace and Righteouſneſs on the other hand: Thus (I ſay) he reveals and offers Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul, and withal, opens his Glory, and cauſes it to ſhine forth before him; ſo that now the Soul ſees that in Chriſt, that fulneſs, that beauty, that love, that amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, that ſweetneſs, which he never ſaw before; Chriſt is now another thing in the Souls eye than ever before he was: Now the Soul, as thoſe <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>Beholds his glory, as the glory of the onely begotten Son, full of grace and truth:</hi> Yea, not only does he thus reveal Chriſt unto the Soul, but withal fixes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94533:31"/>the Souls eye upon him: He makes him to pore and gaze upon Chriſt, as the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and amiable Object, and as one infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely needful for him; and this is called <hi>a ſeeing of the Son,</hi> and that in order to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; <hi>whoſoever ſeeth the Son, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him, ſhall have everlaſting life;</hi> Joh. 6.40. The bleſſed Spirit deals by the Soul herein, as God by the Angels did with <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> Gen. 21.19. where 'tis ſaid, <hi>He opened her eyes, and ſhe ſaw a Well of Water for her relief:</hi> She was in a very diſtreſſed condition, as you may ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16. full of bitterneſs, ſhe and her Child both in a periſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being in the Wilderneſs, and her Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Bottle being ſpent: Now God ſhews her a Well of Wate, whence ſhe fetches a full ſupply. So here, the poor Soul having been under the convincing power of the Law, ſees himſelf in a woful, miſerable, diſteſſed condition; whereupon he is full of bitterneſs, crying out with <hi>Hagar, How ſhall I ſee the Child die?</hi> How can I bear it to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh eternally? But now the Spirit of God comes, and opens his eyes, and ſhews him Chriſt, and Chriſt as infinitely ſutable to him: Look, ſayes the Spirit to the Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now deſolate and undone, look, here is a Saviour for thee, a Husband for thee, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a better Husband than the Law could ever have been, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is infinitely able to pay all thy Debts, to ſupply all thy Wants, to heal all thy Wounds, to relive all thy Diſtreſſes, to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94533:31"/>pardon all thy Sins, to ſatisfie all thy Deſires, to anſwer all thy Love, and to give thee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect happineſs and ſatisfaction in and with himſelf for ever: Look, here he is, here he is in the Promiſe, here he is in the Covenant, here he is in the Tender &amp; Invitation of the Goſpel; here he is at the very door of thy heart, knocking and calling for admiſſion thereunto, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. Here he is with his Arms wide open to receive and embrace thee; and that notwithſtanding all thy vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, finfulneſs, and unworthineſs: Look therefore to him and be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="3">III. With this Tender and Revelation of Chriſt unto the Soul, the Spirit of God comes and works a ſecret love and longing in the Soul after Chriſt; he does not make a naked ender and revelation of Chriſt onely to the Soul; for that were not enough, but he withal gives him a ſecret touch, whereby he is made to breath and long after Chriſt, to move a little Chriſtward; <hi>He drops a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Myrrhe upon the handle of the Lock,</hi> as it were, whereby he is drawn out in holy Longings and Breathings after ſweet Jeſus; as you know the caſe ſometimes was with the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>beg.</hi> and this the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls an hungring and thirſting after Chriſt, and has a bleſſedneſs annext to it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. and frequently elſe-where. Yea, ſuch is that ſecret touch, which in and with thoſe tenders and revelations of Chriſt, the Spirit of God gives the Soul, as that (like
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94533:32"/>that of the Loadſtone to the Needle) which ſets it a trembling, and will not ſuffer it to reſt, till it ſtands fully pointed Chriſtward, yea, till it finds it ſelf in the very boſom and imbraces of that Beloved; 'tis indeed ſuch as by degrees makes the Soul <hi>ſick of love and longings after Chriſt,</hi> Cant. 5.8. and he cries out for Chriſt, as <hi>Rachel</hi> ſometimes did for Children; <hi>Give me Children</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>or elſe I die:</hi> So give me Chriſt, ſayes the Soul, or elſe I die, I periſh, and that for ever: In a word, nothing but Chriſt will ſatisfie him; ſend him to the Creatures, ſend him to his own duties and ſervices, ſend him to his higheſt accompliſhments and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and without Chriſt they will not do; yea, all theſe he accounts <hi>but as dung, as dogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat, that he may win Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.8. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Heaven and Earth, with all the fulneſs of both, are nothing to him without Chriſt, and an union with Chriſt: his language now is, O Chriſt, Chriſt above ten thouſand Worlds! O that Chriſt were mine! O that I had union with him! Oh that I were in his imbraces! Oh how happy are they that are married to him! and how happy ſhould I be could I call him mine! This I ſay is his language, and when once it comes to this, then things work well indeed, then the Match is in a good forwardneſs, there being but an hairs breadth, as it were, between Chriſt and the Soul. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:94533:32"/>IV. The Soul being thus inclined Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and drawn forth in holy Longings after Union and Communion with him;<note place="margin">Sicut Chriſtus per Spiritus ſui communieationem ſeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> the Spirit of God comes and enables him to believe, he carries the Soul to Chriſt in a way of believing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he actually cloſes with him, and is eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him: For, my Beloved, 'tis Faith which ties the Marriage-Knot, and makes up the Marriage-Union between Chriſt and us: Hence Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to dwell in our hearts by Faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. Chriſt's dwelling in our hearts, notes the neareſt Union and Communion between him and us: And how comes he thus to dwell in our hearts? why, by Faith, by our believing on him:<note place="margin">Edis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum non dente ſed fide. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> Hence alſo Chriſt tells us, That <hi>he that eateth his fleſh, and drinketh his blood, dwelleth in him, and he in him,</hi> Joh. 6.56. By eating Chriſts Fleſh, and drinking his Blood, is meant, our believing on him, and ſo he himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, for he makes eating and drinking of him, and believing on him, all one through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Chapter: Now (ſayes he) <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me, and I in him;</hi> that is, he has the neareſt Union and Communion with me: 'tis Faith then (you ſee) that unites, and ſo eſpouſes us to Chriſt: Faith gives Chriſt an inlet into the Soul, and it gives the Soul an inlet into Chriſt, and ſo they are made one and married together. By believing, we conſent to take Chriſt, and actually do take
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94533:33"/>him for our onely Head and Husband for ever; and ſo the Match is made up between him and us:<note place="margin">Nos per fidem, in nobis a Spiritu ſancto excitatam, in hoc cum Chriſto conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium conſentimus. <hi>Zanch.</hi> in Theſ. de conjugio Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuali.</note>

                  </note> as Divines obſerve, Chriſt hath a double Will, his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane; with the firſt, he conſented to this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſal from eternity; with the ſecond, he conſents hereunto in Time, and never changes therein. Now as Chriſt gives his conſent, ſo we alſo muſt give ours; which we do by believing in him; by which therefore the Match is made up between him and us. Now there is a three-fold Act of Faith, which the Spirit of God works in the Soul, whereby he more eſpecially cloſes with Chriſt, and is eſpouſed unto him, made one with him in a Marriage-Covenant.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">I. An Act of Choice or Election: In the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94533:33"/>Act or Work of Believing, the Soul is by the Spirit of God made ſolemnly and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to chuſe Chriſt as his only Head and Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, his Lord and Saviour, being thus offered to him in the Goſpel. Choice or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, as the School-men tell us, is an Act of the Will, whereby it pitches upon ſome one thing, and prefers that before all others in order to ſuch or ſuch an end: Accordingly we may conceive of this Act of Faith we are ſpeaking of: It lies thus, the Will is by the Spirit of God ſweetly and powerfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon Chriſt, preferring him for an Head and Husband, a Lord and Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others: It ſingles him out, as it were, from all others, whether perſons or things, in Heaven and Earth, and imbraces him as the beſt Husband, the beſt Saviour, the beſt Lord: There are others which make love to him, and tender themſelves to his embraces, as Sin, Self, the Law, the World with its intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but he paſſes by all, yea, rejects all with loathing and indignation, and pitches upon Chriſt as infinitely beſt, ſaying to him, <hi>I will have none in Heaven but thee; and there is none upon Earth that I deſire in compariſon of thee.</hi> This the Scripture calls ſometimes <hi>a laying hold upon Chriſt,</hi> Prov. 3.18. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>receiving</hi> or imbracing <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1.12. 'Tis true, in the Work of Faith, Chriſt is and muſt be received into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; but he is moſt properly ſaid to be received into our Will and Affections: Chriſt in the Goſpel is revealed and offered
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94533:34"/>to the Soul with all his Riches, Fulneſs, and Perfections; he is tendered to him, as a full, a mighty, and uttermoſt Saviour, as one who has not onely an infinite fulneſs and ſufficiency in him to redeem and ſave, but alſo an infinite ſutableneſs and amiableneſs in him to indear and delight the Soul; and accordingly the Soul accepts and imbraces him, he cleaves to him, and faſtens upon him, reſolving to have none but him alone: his language of him now is, There is none like Chriſt, no head like this Head, no huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band like this Husband, no ſaviour like this Saviour for my Soul: This is the Head, the Husband, the Saviour that I need, and that indeed my Soul defires: No love like his Love, no beauty like his Beauty, no blood like his Blood, no righteouſneſs like his Righteouſneſs, no fulneſs like his Fulneſs; He therefore, and he alone ſhall be my Head, my Husband, my Saviour, and my All for ever. Sweet Jeſus (ſayes he) doſt thou tender thy ſelf for an Head and Husband to me, and art thou willing to be imbraced by me? Lo then I do with my whole Soul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of thee, and that for all times and in all conditions, with all thine Holineſs as well as thy Love, with all thine Inconveniences as well as thy Priviledges; to ſuffer for thee, as well as to reign with thee; and this the Soul does upon the deepeſt counſel, and moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation; and accordingly he abides by his choice for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:94533:34"/>II. An Act of Truſt or Dependance: As in the Work of Faith the Soul is, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, made to chuſe Chriſt; ſo alſo to truſt and depend upon him for all Grace, Righteouſneſs, and Salvation: Now it bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms upon Chriſt, anchors upon Chriſt, reſts and relies upon Chriſt for all Life and Peace, for all Grace on Earth, and Glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: He layes the whole weight and ſtreſs of his Salvation upon him: He commits all to him, ventures all upon him, expects all from him: This the Scripture calls ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>a truſting in Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1.13. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>leaning upon Chriſt,</hi> Cant. 8.5. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>hoping in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.19. And in this reſpect Chriſt is called <hi>our Hope,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.1. our Hope, that is, the Object of our Hope and Truſt as to Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Soul has no hope in himſelf, no hope in the Creature, no hope in the Law or firſt Covenant, no hope in any thing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth on this ſide Chriſt: He looks here and there, to this and that, but he can find no ſolid ground of hope, no bottom to build or reſt upon for Life and Salvation; but then he turns his eye upon Chriſt, and there he ſees abundant ground of hope; he beholds him upon the Croſs, and there's hope; he beholds him upon the Throne, and there's hope; he looks upon him dying, and there's hope; he looks upon him riſing, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, ſitting at the Father's right Hand, making interceſſion for us, and there's hope: He looks upon the infinite vertue of his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94533:35"/>Blood, the infinite efficacy of his Spirit, the infinite fulneſs of his Grace, the infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of his Love, the infinite freeneſs and faithfulneſs of his Promiſe; and in theſe he ſees infinite ground of hope and truſt; and accordingly he rolls and ventures all upon him: Here I'le build, (ſayes he) here I'le bottom, here I'le reſt, here I'le hang and depend, here I'le live; yea, and if die I muſt, here I'le die. His language to Chriſt now is like that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to God in another caſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.7. <hi>Now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.</hi> This is to <hi>caſt anchor within the Vail,</hi> Heb. 9.6. And indeed, 'tis with poor Souls many times, as with perſons at Sea; the Storm ariſes, the Waves lift up themſelves, which beating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they are ready to ſink every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their very Soul is melted becauſe of heavineſs; but anon they ſound bottom, caſt anchor, and are at reſt: So poor Souls are under ſtorms of ſin, guilt, and wrath, periſhing in their own apprehenſion every moment; but anon they drop an anchor of hope upon Chriſt, and do reſt upon him: or 'tis with them in this caſe, as 'twas with the Dove when ſhe was firſt ſent out of the Ark, ſhe found no reſting place abroad for the ſole of her foot; but at length returned to the Ark, and there found reſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.8, 9. So the poor guilty Soul finds no reſt any where elſe but in Chriſt. His language in this Act of Faith is ſuch as this, I am a poor, loſt, ſinful, diſtreſſed Creature, and there is but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94533:35"/>one door I can expect relief from, and that is Chriſt, and at this door I'le lie and wait; I know he is able to help me, for he can ſave to the uttermoſt: and ſurely he hath bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, great bowels towards poor ſinners; he is a merciful High-Prieſt: He ſayes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, as they ſometimes did concerning the King of Iſrael; <hi>Behold, we have heard, that the King of Iſrael is a merciful King, peradventure he will ſave us:</hi> yea, he has bid me look to him and be ſaved; and he invites all that are weary and heavy-laden, to come to him, and promiſes them reſt: Why then ſhould I not reſt and rely upon him? 'Tis true, I am a mighty ſinner, but he is a more mighty Saviour: Have I ſinned to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt? He has ſatisfied to the utmoſt: What ſhall I ſay? True, I am Death, but Chriſt is Life: I am Darkneſs, but Chriſt is Light; I am Sin, but Chriſt is Holineſs; I am Guilt, but Chriſt is Righteouſneſs; I am Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Nothingneſs, but Chriſt is Fulneſs and Sufficiency; I have broken the Law, but Chriſt has fulfilled the Law; and his Life is infinitely able to ſwallow up my Death; his Light, my Darkneſs; his Holineſs, my Sin; his Righteouſneſs, my Guilt; his Fulneſs, my Emptineſs; on him therefore I'le lean, and live, and hope. 'Tis true, I am utterly unworthy of any Life, any Grace, any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but Chriſt does all for ſinners free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he loves freely, he pardons freely, he ſaves freely, how vile therefore and unworthy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am, yet I will reſt and depend upon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94533:36"/>him: Who knows but he may caſt an eye of love upon me? This is that Act of Faith which is held forth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24. <hi>Surely, ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi> I have neither ſtrength nor righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of my own, but I have all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſtrength in Chriſt; all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for Pardon and Juſtification, and all ſtrength for Holineſs and Sanctification; this is that the Apoſtle calls a <hi>rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus, having no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> Phil. 3.3.</p>
               <p>To draw towards a concluſion of this Head: Which way ſoever the Soul looks on this ſide Chriſt, he meets with nothing but diſcouragement: If he looks to himſelf, there he ſees nothing but ſin and guilt, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deformity; in his heart he ſees a Fountain of ſin, an Abyſſe of ſin, a very Hell of ſin and wickedneſs; in his life he finds innumerable evils, ſins of a crimſon-die and ſcarlet-tincture ſtaring him in the face; yea, his very Duties are not without ſin, even in theſe there is abundance of pride, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, unbelief, and the like: his very <hi>righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags,</hi> Iſa. 64.4. If he looks unto the Law, there he reads his doom and condemnation in every line there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; there he finds himſelf under the Curſe; there he ſees nothing but <hi>fear, and blackneſs, and darkneſs, and tempeſts,</hi> Heb. 12.18. If he looks to juſtice, that he finds as a flaming Sword keeping him from the Tree of Life, from all happineſs: That appears with an
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94533:36"/>angry frowning countenance demanding ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as being infinitely wronged: But now in the midſt of all theſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the poor Soul at length gets a ſight of Chriſt, in whom he ſees encouragement after all: He diſcovers land in a ſtorm, as it were, and finds in him a bottom to reſt his weary Spirit upon; in him he ſees that which can atone God, ſatisfie Juſtice, anſwer all the demands of the Law, fully deliver him from ſin and guilt, and make him both holy and happy for ever; and accordingly he reſts and rolls himſelf upon him, reſolving that if he dies, he will die thus leaning upon this Beloved.</p>
               <p n="3">III. An Act of Reſignation or Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: As in the Work of Faith the Soul thus chuſes Chriſt and depends upon him; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he is by the Spirit of God made cordially and unreſervedly to reſign up himſelf unto him, to be ruled, governed, and diſpoſed of by him in his own way: The Soul now puts himſelf out of his own power and poſſeſſion, he paſſes himſelf away from himſelf, and he gives up himſelf into the power and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt to be ruled, governed, and ſaved by him as he ſees good: which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that Act of Faith which we call Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and this the Scripture often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>One ſhall ſay I am the Lords,</hi> Iſa. 44.5. that is, he ſhall give or reſign up himſelf to the Lord to be for ever his, and at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. <hi>They gave themſelves
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94533:37"/>unto the Lord;</hi> and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.24. the Church is ſaid to be <hi>ſubject to Chriſt:</hi> The Caſe ſeems to be this, there having many Treaties paſt in order to a Match between Chriſt and the Soul, the Soul at length, through the help of the Divine Spirit, is made freely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to take Chriſt for his onely Head and Husband, and to be ſubject to him in all things, to be perfectly and eternally at his diſpoſe: His language now to Chriſt is like that of <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Benhadad,</hi> 1 Kings 20.4. <hi>Behold I am thine, and all that I have is thine:</hi> Sweet Lord Jeſus, ſayes the Soul, I have been my own, and have lived too much in mine own will, and to mine own ends and intereſts; but now I deſire to be thine, and to live in thy Will, and to thine Ends; take poſſeſſion of me, ſave me, rule me, lead me, diſpoſe of me as thou pleaſeſt; do all thy pleaſure in me, pull down and ſet up what thou wilt, I'le be, and do, and ſuffer what thou wilt have me to be, and do, and ſuffer. And this is properly that Act of Faith, whereby we cloſe with Chriſt as a Lord and King, and is indeed the evidence of the Truth of the two former; for you muſt know, that though Faith's firſt Aſpect be to Chriſt as a Saviour, yet it comes to eye him as a Lord and King alſo: As Faith fully bottoms upon the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, ſo it freely bows to the Scepter of Chriſt; yea, when Faith can't challenge Chriſt as a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, yet it will own Chriſt as a Lord: You know how <hi>Laban</hi> ſpake to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94533:37"/>upon the ſight of the Ear-rings and Bracelets which he had given his Siſter <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah,</hi> and upon his hearing a Relation from her of his Diſcourſe with her, <hi>Come in thou bleſſed of the Lord, why ſtandeſt thou without? I have room for thee,</hi> Gen. 24.31. In like manner does the Soul ſpeak to Chriſt upon the ſight of that worth that is in him, and that need which he has of him, Come in thou bleſſed of the Lord, come in thou bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord, why ſtandeſt thou without? I have room for thee; I have room for thee in my Underſtanding, and I have room for thee in my Will and Affections; and I would have thee poſſeſs all, and command all: In a word, the Soul freely gives up himſelf to Chriſt's Holy and Spiritual Government. Thou art an Holy Chriſt, (ſays he) he who is to reign, and I reſign up my ſelf to thee, I'le have no Lord but thee; take the whole Throne to thy ſelf within me; I know thy Yoke is an eaſie Yoke, and I deſire to bear it; thy Scepter is a Righteous Scepter, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to bow to it; thy Kingdom is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Rightcouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and I heartily deſire to come under the power of it. I would be Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as well as Juſtified; I deſire thy Spirit to ſubdue my corruptions for me, and to make me Holy, as well as thy Blood to waſh away my guilt for me, and ingratiate me with thy ſelf: and this is what the Scripture calls <hi>an opening of the Gates, and a lifting up of the everlaſting Doors, to let Chriſt the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94533:38"/>King of Glory in,</hi> Pſal 24.7. Thus by theſe three, which indeed are the great uniting Acts of Faith, the Spirit of God enables the Soul to cloſe with Chriſt in a Marriage-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Relation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Soul being thus enabled to believe, and ſo cloſe with Chriſt in a Marriage-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; then, as the Crown and perfection of all, the bleſſed Spirit of God takes up his abode, and dwells for ever in that Soul, as the Pledge and everlaſting Bond of this Marriage-union and Relation between them. The ſweet Spirit does not onely come, as a Friend, to treat about the Match, and alſo to tie the Marriage-Knot between Chriſt and us; but moreover, this being done, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains himſelf in the Soul, as a Love-Token from Chriſt to him, as the Pawn and Pledge of this Eſpouſal, and as the everlaſting Bond and Confirmation of this Marriage-Union and Relation: Hence that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. one Spirit with the Lord he is joyned to; that Spirit which did joyn him to Chriſt, does remain in him and in Chriſt both: Chriſt leaves his own Spirit in his Spouſes, as the Pledge and Bond of that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Union that is between him and them; ſo that he and they have the ſame Spirit dwelling in them; yet with this difference, he dwells in Chriſt without meaſure, in us by meaſure; in Chriſt immediately, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the perſonal Union, in us by his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94533:38"/>Gifts and Graces; in Chriſt, as an Head, in us as members; and he with theſe are the Love-Tokens, the Pawns and Pledges of this Marriage-Troth plighted between Chriſt and us; and this indeed is that which makes this Union ſo ſtrong and inviolable, as that it can never be broken: Yea, not onely does he remain in the Soul as the Pledge and Bond of this Union, but alſo to deck and adorn the Soul with Grace, and to make him ready for the conſummation of the Marriage above: you know, when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Servant ſaw that <hi>Rebekah</hi> conſented to be <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Wife, he then gave her <hi>Jewels of Silver, and Jewels of Gold, and rich Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Gen. 24.53. So the bleſſed Spirit of God, having gained the Souls conſent to be eſpouſed to Chriſt, and the Marriage-Knot being tyed between them, now he dwells in the Soul to deck and adorn him; now he gives him Jewels of Gold and Silver, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes and beautifies him with all Divine and Heavenly Graces; He dwells in him as an indeficient Spring and Fountain of all Grace and gracious diſpoſitions, till he has lodged him ſafe in the Arms and Boſom of his ſweet Husband above. Thus at length the Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal or Marriage-Relation is made up between Chriſt and the Soul; And oh how bleſſed is the Soul that is thus eſpouſed to him! I muſt ſay to ſuch a Soul, Bleſſed be the day that ever thou wert born; bleſſed the Womb that bear thee, and bleſſed the Paps which gave thee ſuck; bleſſed Goſpel which revealed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94533:39"/>this ſweet Chriſt to thee, and bleſſed Spirit that has tyed this happy Knot between him and thee.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Being a Call to and Treaty with Souls, in order to an Eſpouſal between Chriſt and them.</head>
               <p>WEll, and what is the meaning of all this? Surely it ſhould have a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty influence upon the Spirits of men to draw and allure them to Chriſt, to induce them at leaſt to look after an acquaintance with this bleſſed eſpouſal to him; and indeed I would take occaſion hence to treat with eternal Souls in order to a Match between Chriſt and them: And oh that I could do it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally! Look, my Beloved, as <hi>David</hi> ſent his Servants to <hi>Abigail</hi> to commune with her, in order to his taking of her to Wife, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.39, 40. ſo has the Lord Jeſus ſent me, his poor unworthy Servant, to you this day to commune with you in order to the eſpouſing of you to himſelf; and oh that you would do in this caſe as ſhe did in that; for <hi>ſhe haſted</hi> ('tis ſaid) <hi>and aroſe, and went to</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>and became his Wife,</hi> verſ. 42. Oh that you would all ariſe, ariſe out of your ſins, ariſe out of your unbelief, ariſe out of your
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94533:39"/>carnal ſecurity, and go to Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Spouſe: And not only ſo, but, as ſhe did make haſte in the buſineſs, cloſe ſpeedily with him in a Marriage-Covenant, even to day: O bleſſed day, might I ſucceed as they did! How happy would it be for you? how comfortable for me? and how joyful for us all in the day of the Bridegrooms coming! Sirs, let me ſay, Oh that I might ſay of you, at leaſt ſome of you, as <hi>Paul</hi> of his <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> here, <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, even to Chriſt:</hi> And why ſhould it not be thus? Why ſhould you not ariſe, and go with me to ſweet Jeſus, and be eſpouſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? Can you make light of all that Love, that Comfort, that Sweetneſs, that Happineſs, that bleſſed Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that Delight, Solace, and Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Soul which this Eſpouſal carries in it? Or, is there any thing can make up the loſs of theſe? Can Sin and the Creature afford any thing comparable hereunto? Surely there is more ſweetneſs, more happineſs, in one kiſs of the mouth of this bleſſed Lord, in one imbrace in his Boſom, one moments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, than in all the delights of Sin and the Creature: If you doubt it, come and ſee, experienced Souls will tell you, that one deſcent of love from Chriſt, one beam of the light of his Countenance, one turn with him in his Galleries, is infinitely beyond all earthly delights whatſoever. Again, can you be content to die, and periſh eternally, rather than live, and be made happy in ſuch a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94533:40"/>ſweet and deſirable way as this of being eſpouſed to Chriſt is? A more ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable way of being made happy than this of an eſpouſal to Chriſt, ſurely neither Men nor Angels could ever have thought on: And can you, O eternal Souls, be content to die, to periſh, to be damned and miſerable for ever, rather than be ſaved and made happy this way? If you get not Union with, and a Marriage-Relation to this ſweet Lord, you muſt die and periſh for ever; <hi>Know you not</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobates,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. If Chriſt be not in us we are certainly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, we are rejected of God, and out of his favour, and then ſurely we muſt periſh. Naturally we are all dead, all loſt, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; <hi>Judgment is come upon all men to condemnation,</hi> Rom. 5.18. and <hi>we are all the children of wrath by nature,</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. And if ever we be juſtified and ſaved, it muſt be by a Marriage-Union and Relation to Chriſt. <hi>There is no condemnation,</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) or as the words are, nothing of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. But, as is there implyed, there is nothing but condemnation to them that are out of Chriſt Jeſus. Once more, can you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be ſhut out from the Marriage at laſt for ever? Think of that Scripture, and bear the dread of it if you can, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.10. <hi>And they that were ready went into the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and the door was ſhut,</hi> ſhut againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who then would fain enter: To be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94533:40"/>ſhut out from the Marriage-Supper at laſt, is to be ſhut out from God, from Chriſt, from the Comforter, from all the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, from all happineſs, yea, and from all hopes of happineſs for ever: and thus you muſt expect to be ſhut out from the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age at laſt, if you come not into an eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to him here: And can you bear it, think you? Can you be content to hear Chriſt ſay unto you at laſt, <hi>Depart from me, depart?</hi> You would have none of me on earth, though I wooed and beſought you with tears; and therefore now you ſhall have none of me in Heaven: you might have been happy in a union and communion with me, and the arms of my love were open to have received you; but you would not, therefore now <hi>depart from me, I know you not:</hi> And can you bear this? Beſides, what is it that keeps your Soul from a cloſe with Chriſt in this Marriage-Relation? A vain World, a filthy Luſt, a painted periſhing Pleaſure, a ſenſual Appetite: And are theſe better than Chriſt? Are theſe indeed things to be laid in the Ballance by you againſt Chriſt, yea, and to down-weigh him in your values? O monſtrous ſtupidity! In ſhort, Sirs, the Matter I am treating with you about is no trifle, 'tis of no leſs moment and importance to you, than eternal Life or Death, eternal Salvation or Damnation comes to; your eternal All depends upon it, for you muſt live or die, be ſaved or damned eternally, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you do, or do not cloſe in with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94533:41"/>Chriſt in a Marriage-Union and Relation here: Why then ſhould you ſtand off from him? Yea, why ſhould not this be the day of eſpouſals between him and you? Oh, be not ſhie, be not coy to Chriſt, but embrace his love: ſurely his Arms are wide open to receive you, his Heart is upon you, and his deſire is towards you; <hi>Lift up therefore the everlaſting Doors, and let this King of Glory in:</hi> Give up your Names and Souls unto him for ever. Some of you are young, and have your Affections green and freſh: Oh that you would now go with me to ſweet Jeſus, and become his Spouſe; you cannot love him, nor be married to him too ſoon: Oh, let him have your hearts before this World hath defiled and debauched them: Others of you are older, and have outſtood the Calls and Offers of Chriſt long; yet loe, he once more tenders himſelf to you: Oh now cloſe with him, and all will be well yet. But for the better ſucceeding of this Treaty, I ſhall, in the managing of it, ſpeak to three things. (1.) I'le ſhew you what manner of Husband the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is, and how he is qualified to render him deſirable in that Relation. (2.) I'le ſhew you what great things he does for all his Spouſes. (3.) I'le ſhew you how much his heart is upon a Match with you. And now as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant, when he was to get a Wife for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Prayed ſaying, <hi>O Lord God of my Maſter</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſend me good ſpeed this day,</hi> Gen. 2.12. So would I, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94533:41"/>the bended knees of my Soul pray, O Lord God, the God and Father of my Royal Maſter, Jeſus Chriſt, ſend me good ſpeed this day, that I may win, through thy Grace, a Spouſe for him.</p>

Riches of Life and Love, Peace and Pardon, Grace and Glory, Righteouſneſs and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Riches of Glory, and Riches in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And O what poor things are the Riches of this World to theſe?

The riches of this World are but painted riches, his are ſubſtantial Riches; <hi>I will cauſe them that love me, to inherit Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> Prov. 8.21. The riches of this World

Now we enjoy them, but all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain they are gone and diſappear; but Chriſts are eternal Riches for an eternal Soul: And as his Riches are thus of the beſt ſort, ſo he has great abundance of them; his Riches are boundleſs and unſearchable: <hi>To me</hi> (ſayes <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>it is given to preach the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 3.8. <hi>He is Heir of all things,</hi> Heb. 1.2. All the Treaſures of Heaven and Earth are his: <hi>He has all fulneſs dwelling in him,</hi> Col. 1.19 even all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the God-head, whole God dwells in him; He has enough to ſupply all our wants, and to anſwer all our deſires: Do we want Grace? <hi>He is full of Grace,</hi> John 1.14. Do we want Life? <hi>With him is the Fountain of Life,</hi> Pſal. 36.9. Do we want Redemption, redemption from Sin, from Death, from Hell, from Wrath? <hi>With him is plenteous Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Pſal. 130.7. Do we want Peace? He gives peace; <hi>My Peace I give unto you,</hi> Joh. 14.27. Do we want Righteouſneſs; <hi>He has fulfilled all Righteouſneſs,</hi> he is become <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23.6. Now will you reject this rich Lord? You are poor, and miſerable, and naked; and will you not embrace this Chriſt, tendering himſelf with all theſe Riches to you? O how juſtly then
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94533:44"/>will you periſh for ever! O that there were ſome covetous Soul here this day, that would be taken with the Riches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Are you for Bounty, for a noble and generous Spirit? That's deſirable in ſuch a Relation, and takes much with many, for this alſo, none like Chriſt: He is a bountiful Lord, of a noble and generous Spirit, as well as Rich: Many a Man has riches enough, but has a baſe, narrow, covetous Spirit; and ſo his Wife has little of them; but Chriſt has a noble, generous, bountiful heart: He is not only rich, but he is alſo willing to lay out all his Riches &amp; Treaſures upon his Spouſes: All the Treaſures of his Love and Grace, all the Treaſures of his Righteouſneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation: He would have them abundantly filled, abundantly comforted, abundantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched for ever: What a generous Spirit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them does he expreſs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Eat, O Friends; Drink, yea drink abundantly, O Beloved:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I have enough, infinitely enough for you, and I would have you to have enough, I would have you to have your Souls full of all Good: He would have them to have full Graces, full Joyes, full Comforts, and full Happineſs for ever; <hi>Theſe things ſpeak I unto you,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that your joy may be full,</hi> John 15.11. And again, <hi>Ask, that you may receive, that your joy may be full,</hi> John 16.24. He wills them like happineſs with himſelf: Like love and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces in the Fathers Boſom, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24, 26.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94533:45"/>Like Grace and Holineſs, <hi>John</hi> 17.22. O what a noble, generous, bountiful heart has this ſweet Lord towards his Spouſe! Soul, ſhall it not draw and allure thee to him? Nothing will ſatisfie him leſs than their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating with him in his own bleſſedneſs: Soul, if thou rejecteſt this bountiful Lord, know, that he has Treaſures of Wrath and Vengeance alſo, which he will plentifully pour out upon thee for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Are you for Wiſdom and Knowledge? Wiſdom and Knowledge render a perſon lovely and deſirable; 'tis indeed one of a perſons higheſt excellencies and perfections: for this alſo none like Chriſt; <hi>He is the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the Power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24. The infinite Wiſdom of the Eternal God does ſhine forth in him and through him: Yea, <hi>in him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.3. Which may be underſtood Actively as well as Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, he knowing all, as well as having all that is worth knowing in him; <hi>He is the only wiſe God,</hi> Jude 25. There is no true wiſdom but in him, and there is no true wiſdom to be had but by him and from him; he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Scripture called <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to note that infinite wiſdom that is in him: He knows all Perſons and all Things; he knows the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that, as he is known of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15. He knows the Mind and Will of the Father; hence ſaid <hi>to be in his Boſom,</hi> which is the place of Secrets, as well as Love, <hi>Joh.</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:94533:45"/>1.18. He knows all his Fathers Counſels and Decrees, which have been of old touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Salvation and Damnation of Man: Hence we read of <hi>the Lambs Book of Life, and Names written therein,</hi> Rev. 13.8. He knows all the Works of God the Father; <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and ſheweth him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth,</hi> John 5.20. He knows the Attributes and Perfections of God, and he only, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>John</hi> 4.56. He knows the whole Word of God, being himſelf <hi>the Word,</hi> Joh. 1.1. 'Tis obſerved by one, that the Angels themſelves do not know all the Word of God, but Chriſt does: And as he thus knows God, and the Things of God, ſo he alſo knows Man, and the Things of Man; <hi>He knows all men, and what is in them,</hi> John 2.24, 25. He knows the State, the Spirits, the Frames, the Thoughts, the Ends, the Counſels, the Wayes, the Wants, the Burthens, the Temptations of all: In a word, he is infinite in Wiſdom and Counſel, and he knows perfectly, as how to promote his own Glory, ſo how to defend, ſave, and comfort his Spouſes, and carry on their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the beſt way: O who would not have ſuch an Husband! Soul, if thou reject him, know, that his Wiſdom will fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee; and he does know how to damn and deſtroy for ever.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Are you for Beauty? That takes with moſt; for this none like Chriſt: For Beauty and Comelineſs, he infinitely ſurpaſſes both
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94533:46"/>Men and Angels. We read of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he was <hi>exceeding fair;</hi> and of <hi>David,</hi> that he was <hi>ruddy, and of a beautiful countenance;</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports of the one of them, that all that ſaw him, were amazed at, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured on his beauty. O but what was their beauty to Chriſts? Were their beauty, and with theirs, the beauty of Men and Angels put together, it would all be nothing to the Beauty of Chriſt: Not ſo much as the light of a Farthing-Candle is to the light of the Sun at noon-day: He is <hi>Beautiful and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> Iſa. 4.2. Was <hi>Moſes</hi> fair? Chriſt is infinitely more fair: <hi>He is fairer than the Children of Men,</hi> Pſal. 45.2. And had you an eye to behold his Beauty, you could not but be amazed at it, and enamoured on it: Was <hi>David</hi> ruddy, and of a beautiful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance? See what the Spouſe ſays of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. <hi>My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt of ten thouſand:</hi> which notes the perfection of his Beauty; and therefore ſhe concludes all with this, (having ſpoken of the Beauty of his ſeveral parts) <hi>He is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lovely,</hi> verſ. 16. or he is all lovelineſs: as if ſhe ſhould ſay, What do I do? there is no end of his beauty and amiableneſs; there is nothing in him but what is lovely, and there is nothing lovely but what is in him; neither is there any thing in the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that has beauty and amiableneſs enough in it to be a ſhadow and reſemblance of his beauty and amiableneſs. <hi>O fair Sun</hi> (ſayes <hi>Rutherford</hi>) <hi>and fair Moon, and fair
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94533:46"/>Stars, and fair Flowers, and fair Roſes, and fair Lillies; but O ten thouſand thouſand times fairer Lord Jeſus! Alas, I have wronged him</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>in making the compariſon this way: O black Sun and Moon! but O fair Lord Jeſus! O black Flowers, and black Lillies and Roſes! but O fair, fair, ever fair Lord Jeſus! O black Heaven! but O fair Chriſt! O black Angels! but O ſurpaſſingly fair Lord Jeſus!</hi> In ſhort, Divines obſerve that there is ſomewhat in Chriſt more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than Salvation; and indeed there are thoſe Heart-indearing Beauties, thoſe Soul-raviſhing excellencies in the perſon of this Beloved, that are unſpeakably beyond Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf: He is the brightneſs, the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre, the ſhining forth <hi>of his Fathers Glory,</hi> Heb. 1.2. O who would not be raviſhed with, and enamoured on his Beauty? A ſmall ſight and report thereof ſet the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a ſeeking after him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.1. And ſhall it have no influence upon you to draw and allure you to him? Does one ſo fair and beautiful make love to ſuch black and deformed Creatures as you and I are, and ſhall we refuſe him? Shall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this lovely Lord? O that his Beauty might enamour us!</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Are you for Love, as well as Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? for a ſweet, kind, loving Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? This is deſirable to all, for this alſo none like Chriſt: He is of a moſt ſweet, loving, tender, affable Diſpoſition: He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94533:47"/>is love it ſelf, kindneſs it ſelf,<note place="margin">Deus eſt totus amor, totus amabilis, et totus amans noſtri. <hi>Dix.</hi>
                  </note> tenderneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion it ſelf: <hi>God is love,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. His love to his Spouſes has all dimenſions, <hi>heights, breadths, depths, lengths</hi> in it; <hi>Yea, it paſſes Knowledg,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Menſuratione iſthac, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectionis illius immenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitatem &amp; immenſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem indicat Apoſtolus. <hi>Glaſ. Rhet. Sac.</hi>
                  </note> Epheſ. 3.18, 19. which ſhews the immenſity and unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs of his love; as if he ſhould ſay of it, 'tis higher than Heaven, and deeper than the Sea; 'tis broader than the Orb of the Earth, and longer than all Time, during throughout Eternity; yea, and it paſſes Knowledge. There are two things which exceed our knowledge; our Sins, and Chriſts Love; the one is almoſt, the other is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther boundleſs, and bottomleſs. Though a man has never ſo many accompliſhments to commend him, yet if he be of a rough, crabbed, ſoure diſpoſition, this renders him unacceptable for ſuch a Relation: But to all his other perfections, Chriſt has this added, That he is infinitely loving as well as love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of a moſt kind, tender diſpoſition to his Spouſes. Hence we read in Scripture of his Love, his Kindneſs, his Meekneſs, his Gentleneſs, and the like; all noting the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſweetneſs and amiableneſs of his Diſpoſition: he wept over his very enemies, even them that finally refuſed him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41, 42. Yea, he had a kindneſs for his Murtherers, and prayed for them, and that whilſt they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94533:47"/>were murthering of him; yea, and his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er carried many of them to Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. O what love, what kindneſs their muſt he have for his Spouſes? He that has love for Enemies, and ſuch love, what muſt he have for his Friends? 'Tis a ſweet gloſs which one of the Ancients has upon the place laſt quoted,<note place="margin">Pater ignoſce illis. O Verbum ſummi Patris Verbo conveniens! orat non ſolum pro perſequentibus &amp; calumniantibus; ſed eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am pro occidentibus: ſed &amp; Pater inquit, <hi>q. d.</hi> Per di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectionem Paternam qua unum ſumus, ſupplico ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi, ut exaudtas me pro his occiſoribus meis, ignoſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do; agnoſce Filii tui ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citiam ut inimicis ignoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas. <hi>Bern. de paſſ.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do: This</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>is a Word becoming the eternal Word, the Word of the eternal Father; he prayes not onely for his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors and Reproachers, but even for his Murtherers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving all his intereſt in his Father for them; ſaying, in effect, Father I intreat thee, by that fatherly love thou haſt for me, and by which we are one, hear me for theſe my Murtherers in forgiving of them, own the love of thy Son, that thou mayeſt pardon his enemies.</hi> O what kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does this argue? In a word, his love is as an Ocean, which has neither brim nor bottom; neither can he but be kind to his: <hi>The Law,</hi> indeed, <hi>of kindneſs</hi> (as 'tis ſaid of the good Wife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.26.) <hi>is in his lips;</hi> yea, and in his heart and carriages too, all being full of love: Oh! that his love might draw you: Surely no love like his love, none ſo full, none ſo free, none ſo ſweet, none ſo fruitful, none ſo raviſhing, none ſo laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; his love, where he loves, never fails,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94533:48"/>nor can it ever be broken off; <hi>Who ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>from the love of Chriſt?</hi> That is, nothing can ſeparate us from his love, <hi>Neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor Things to come, nor Heighth, nor Depth, nor any thing elſe can do it,</hi> Rom. 8. 35, 38, 39. And I think, ſayes an Holy Man, his unchangable love hath ſaid unto me, I defie thee to break me or change me: Oh ſirs, experienced Souls will tell you, how ſweet, and good, and rich Chriſt's love is: They will tell you, one ſight, one taſte of it, makes Heaven in the Soul; that <hi>'tis better than Wine,</hi> Cant. 1.2. And will you reject him and his love too? Will you pour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon ſo much kindneſs? O how juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then will you periſh under his wrath? He has wrath in him, as well as love; wrath for Enemies, as well as love for his Spouſes; and his wrath is as hot and terrible, as his love is ſweet and comfortable; yea, his love will, if rejected by you, turn into wrath, and no wrath like that that is the reſult of abuſed love: Oh therefore cloſe, cloſe with Chriſt this day.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Are you for a Perſon of eſteem, one that is much valued and beloved? An inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Soul would deſire this: and for this none like Chriſt: As there is none ſo kind and loving as he, ſo there is none ſo much valued and beloved as he: He is beloved by all whoſe love is worth the having; He is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94533:48"/>highly valued and beloved by all the Saints both in Heaven and Earth; the Saints in Heaven they admire and adore him; 'tis a part of their happineſs to love him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him for ever: and the Saints on Earth, they love and value him above all others whatever; he is the dearly Beloved of their Souls: How often does the Spouſe call him her Beloved, and her Well-Beloved? And once and again, ſhe declares her ſelf ſick of love to him; ſhe is enamoured on him; he is indeed <hi>the deſire of all Nations,</hi> Hag. 2.7. That is to ſay, He whom all the faithful in all Nations do love, deſire, and delight in: Hence alſo that of the <hi>Apoſtle, to you that believe he is precious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7. The Saints love and value Chriſt above all their Natural or Creature-Enjoyments, above Father, and Mother, Husband, and Wife, and Children, and Houſes, and Lands, and the like: So much is intimated <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37. &amp; 19.29. they love and value him above all their Spiritual Attainments, <hi>accounting them but Dung for Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.8. They love and value him above their lives, being <hi>ready to die for him,</hi> Acts 21.13. Rev. 12.11. Oh how dear is Chriſt to Saints? He is alſo highly valued and beloved by all the Holy Angels: He is the great object of their Love and Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Hence he is ſaid to be <hi>ſeen of Angels,</hi> that is, to be beloved and delighted in by Angels, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. The bleſſed Angels do ſee that in Chriſt, which does enamour them on him, and fill them with love to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94533:49"/>him, and delight in him; yea, which does fill them with perpetual admirings and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12. Yea, which is more than all this, He is infinitely valued and beloved by God the Father alſo: The bleſſed God ſees that in Chriſt that renders him infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely amiable and deſireable in his Eye, and to his Soul; both as Son, and alſo as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, he is even infinitely dear and precious to the Father: As he is the Son of God, the Son of the Father, as the Apoſtles expreſſion is, ſo is he the Darling and Delight of the Fathers Soul, and was ſo from all eternity; ſo much he himſelf tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. So he is the infinite and eternal Favorite of the infinite and eternal Father; ſo he is one in eſſence with the Father, and accordingly muſt be infinitely dear to the Father: Hence he is ſaid <hi>to be in the Fathers boſom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tilius in ſinu Patris eſt. 1. In aeterna generatione. 2. In arctiſſima unitate. 3. In ardentiſſima dilecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one. 4. In ſecretiſſimorum communicatione. <hi>Glaſſ. Rhet. Sac.</hi>
                  </note> and as Son, he was ſo from eternity, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. Now the Boſom is the ſeat of Love, and his being in his Fathers Boſom, notes that ſtrong, ardent, intimate love which the Father has for him; yea, even as Mediator the Father loves him, <hi>John</hi> 3.35. Yea, he loves him with a choice, a ſignal, and an eminent love, with a love of the higheſt ſtrain, the choiceſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, the ſweeteſt influence; a love that has a ſtamp of ſpecial glory upon it: Hence he is called <hi>the Beloved,</hi> Epheſ. 1.6. <hi>He hath

                  </note> that is, in Chriſt, who is moſt dear to God: Hence God calls him <hi>his beloved Son, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3.17.<note place="margin">Filius dilectionis, <hi>i.e.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius dilectiſſimus. <hi>Daven in loc.</hi>
                  </note> Yea, he is called the Son of his Love; <hi>he hath tranſlated us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of his dear Son,</hi> the Greek is the Son of his Love, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. Yea, the Father proclaims him to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of his Soul: <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom I have choſen, mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth,</hi> Iſa. 42.1.

                  </note> and next to himſelf he loves Chriſt and delights in him: 'tis true, he loves all the works of his hands as ſuch, eſpecially rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and among them, he has a peculiar love for his Saints and the Holy Angels, but he loves Chriſt unſpeakably more than all: He indeed is firſt Beloved, and moſt Beloved, and beſt Beloved by him of all others.<note place="margin">Naturam humanam aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptam a Dei Verbo in Perſona Chriſti, Deus plus amat quam omnes Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los. <hi>Aqui.</hi>
                  </note> God, as the School-men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, does love the very fleſh or Humane Nature of Chriſt more than all the Angels: In a word, he loves him ſo, as that he is even raviſhed with him, and he can't but love all that are in him, or related by Covenant to him; and that though alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94533:50"/>unlovely in themſelves. Now, Sirs, will you not love and embrace this beloved one, one that is thus valued and beloved by Saints, by Angels, and by God the Father? And let me ſay, one that is hated and deſpiſed by none but Devils and deviliſh ones: Soul, if thou reject him, whom all the Saints and Angels love, admire, and adore; then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect to live with them in the fruition of him, But reckon upon living with Devils and damned ſpirits in Hell for ever: If thou reject him whom the Father loves and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in, then expect to be rejected both by him and the Father for ever; but, Soul, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be prevailed with to love him too.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Are you for Immortality, for one that lives for ever? This added to the reſt is deſirable; and for this none like Chriſt: Yea, none but Chriſt, he and he alone is a never-dying Husband; the beſt Husband here below is mortal, and may leave you in a moment; but Chriſt is immortal, <hi>he is the King immortal, eternal,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.17. <hi>and he only hath immortality,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.16. He, and he onely lives for evermore: <hi>Behold! I live for evermore,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. He will never leave you in the deſolate ſtate of Widdow-hood; yea, not onely does he live for ever himſelf, but moreover he makes all his Spouſes to live for ever too: So you find John 11.25, 26. <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live; and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94533:50"/>whoſoever liveth, and believeth in me, ſhall never die.</hi> Oh what an Husband is this! an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that lives for ever himſelf, and that makes his Spouſes live for ever too; he gives all his Spouſes ſuch a life as never dies, an immortal life. In a word, cloſe with him, and as he will live for ever, as thy Husband, ſo thou ſhalt live for ever as his Spouſe: Oh who would not accept of ſuch a Perſon? Soul, if thou receiveſt him, know, he lives for ever, to love thee, to comfort thee, to delight thee, to make thee happy in and with himſelf; but if thou rejecteſt him, know, that he lives for ever to puniſh thee, to inflict wrath and vengance upon thee, and to make thee compleatly miſerable; but oh reject him not. Thus I have ſhewn you a little what an Husbund Chriſt is to his Spouſes; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, I would ſay to you as the Spouſe did to the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Cant. 5.16. <hi>This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend;</hi> this is he that offers himſelf to your embraces, ſurely he is no mean, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable Perſon, but one infinitely deſireable. Now, what do you ſay? will you have him, or will you not? poſſibly this is the laſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he will ever make of himſelf to you; poſſibly the Match muſt be made now or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; therefore now cloſe with him, accept him upon his own terms, who ſurely is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation.</p>

Adam</hi> ſinned, and we all ſinned in him,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94533:52"/>we all being in him, as in a common Head; and the guilt of the act of his ſin is as truly ours, as if we had each one of us acted it in our own perſons; and we all ſtand juſtly condemned for it. Hence alſo, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. he tells us, That <hi>by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Beſides, we have all contracted a vaſt Debt upon our ſelves, and do lie under much actual guilt, and that of a ſcarlet-dye and crimſon-tincture: Alas, we have done little but ſin'd ever ſince we came into the World; and indeed, as long as we are out of Chriſt, either all we do is ſin, or at leaſt we ſin in all we do: We are every day run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon new Scores, adding ſin to ſin, and guilt to guilt: And O how great then muſt our Debts to Law and Juſtice needs be? You look upon that man to be deeply in debt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, whoſe Debts are ſo many and great, as that he can neither know nor count them: And thus it is with us, ſo many and ſo great are our Sins, and conſequently our Debts to Law and Juſtice, that we can neither know nor count them. <hi>David,</hi> though an holy Man, cries out, <hi>Who can underſtand his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors?</hi> Pſal. 19.12. Alas, who of us can count the ſins of one day? they paſs our knowledge: And which is worſe ſtill, we are under a neceſſity, whilſt in our natural ſtate, of encreaſing our ſin and guilt every day and hour. Now how ſhall all this Debt be paid, this Sin and Guilt be expiated and done away? Why only by Chriſt, cloſe with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94533:52"/>him in a Marriage-Covenant, and your Souls are diſcharged from all. Juſtice, that ſtands upon Satisfaction, it calls for full payment; its language is, Pay, or periſh; pay, or be damned; and nothing have we of our own to pay the leaſt of all our Debts, nor can we poſſibly right God for the wrong we have done him by the leaſt fin; and, which adds to our miſery, we are every day in danger of Arreſts, nor know we how ſoon Juſtice will by the hand of that grim Sergeant, Death, clap an Arreſt upon us, and caſt us into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whence there is no redemption, until we have paid the utmoſt farthing, which can never be, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.26. Now ſinner wouldſt thou have thy Debts paid, thy Sins Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thy Soul freed from the danger of thoſe Arreſts? then give up thy ſelf to Chriſt in a Marriage-Covenant: O this is the only way to diſcharge all. Chriſt ſayes to Juſtice concerning all his Spouſcs, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did to <hi>Philemon</hi> concerning <hi>Oneſimus; If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee any thing, put that upon my account:</hi> So ſayes Chriſt to God concerning thee immediately upon thy cloſe with him; Father, if this Soul hath wronged thee, and oweth thee any thing, place it on my account, I have taken all his Debts upon me, I'le be reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to thee for all: Father, this Soul I bled and dyed for, this Soul I was made ſin and a curſe for, whereby thy Juſtice is fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; let him therefore be diſcharged. O Soul, how ſhould this draw thee to Chriſt?
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94533:53"/>Canſt thou be content to lie under ſo great a Debt? And is it a ſmall thing to thee to be in danger of ſo terrible an Arreſt as that of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which we have ſpoken of, is? Suppoſe a man owed ten thouſand pounds, and had nothing wherewith to pay, and he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in danger every moment of being caſt into Priſon; how ſad wouldſt thou look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his caſe to be? and how gladly, thinkeſt thou, would he embrace an offer from any to diſcharge him from all? Soul, thy caſe is ten thouſand times more ſad, and how glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhouldſt thou embrace the Lord Jeſus, who would, and who alone can diſcharge all for thee: In ſhort, we read of <hi>Spirits already in Priſon,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.19. Juſtice has already clapt its Arreſt upon thouſands and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and lodg'd them in the Priſon of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal darkneſs; and what canſt thou expect from it, but to be dealt with in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſpeedily, unleſs thou cloſeſt with Chriſt, as thy Righteouſneſs, to make ſatisfaction for thee? His Righteouſneſs is ſuch, as makes a full ſatisfaction, and is every way anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſtricteſt demands of Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and by it, he being cloſed withal by thee, all thy Debts are paid at once.</p>
               <p n="2">II. He ſupplies all their Wants, and makes bleſſed proviſion for them: 'Tis the part of an Husband to ſupply the wants of his Wife, and to make proviſion for her: And this Chriſt does for all his Spouſes; <hi>he ſupplies all their needs according to his riches in glory:</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:94533:53"/>They have Wants, and he has Fulneſs; they have Needs, and he has Riches; and he brings his Fuineſs to their Wants, and freely communicates of the one to the other: Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are full of Wants of all ſorts, Wants in the Soul, and Wants in the Body, <hi>We are poor, and miſerable, and blind, and naked,</hi> Rev. 3.17. Yea, our Wants are ſuch, and ſo prinching upon us, that with the Prodigal, we are even <hi>periſhing with hunger.</hi> Luke 15.17. Even the Saints themſelves are <hi>a poor and needy people,</hi> full of wants, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.17. Now how ſhall theſe Wants be ſupplyed? Only by Chriſt, and do but cloſe with him, and he will ſupply all plentifully: Liet it be but a day of Eſpouſals between Chriſt and you, and all your Wants are ſupplyed for ever. The truth is, Chriſt is all; He is the great All, (as one calls him) Heaven, and Earth, Time and Eternity, Grace and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are all in one Chriſt: He ſupplies the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Wants of his Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94533:54"/>fill you with joy and conſolation, he will comfort your hearts, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. He ſupplies all the outward Wants alſo of his Spouſes, and that ſo as that they want no good thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. They want no outward good thing; but what the want thereof is better for them, than the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it would be: True, they may, and often have but a little of outward Comforts; but yet then they have much in a little, much Love, much Bleſſing, much of Chriſt and the Covenant: And therefore <hi>a little which they have, is ſaid to be better than the riches of many wicked,</hi> Pſalm 37.16. Beſides, wherein they are cut ſhort in Temporals, Chriſt often makes it up to them in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: They are <hi>poor in this World, but rich in Faith,</hi> Jam. 2.5. They have not much of the Streams, it may be, but they have the more of the Fountain; more love, and the ſweeter communion with Chriſt: In a word, what-ever either Heaven or Earth affords, ſo far as they need it, they ſhall have it: <hi>The Lord will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,</hi> Pſal. 84.9. O who would not cloſe with this Chriſt? Soul, why ſtandeſt thou off from him? Is there any can ſupply thy Wants but he? Is there any can give thee Life, and Peace, and Pardon, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and Salvation, but he? Or hadſt thou rather die in thy Wants, than come to this Fountain to be ſupplyed? Hadſt thou ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94533:54"/>periſh in thine own poverty, than come to this Treaſury to be enriched?</p>
               <p n="3">III. He heals all their Wounds, and cures all their Maladies: He is a Phyſician to his Spouſes, and ſuch a Phyſician; as that though the Wound be never ſo deep, and the Diſeaſe never ſo deſperate, yet he never fails to work the Cure for them: O how ſhould this allure us to him? We, my Beloved, have our Wounds as well as our Wants; we are full of Maladies and Diſeaſes of Soul: The truth is, <hi>from the ſole of the foot to the crown of the head, there is no ſoundneſs in us,</hi> Iſa. 1.6. The Saints themſelves have their Wounds, yea <hi>wounds</hi> many times, <hi>that ſtink, and are corrupt,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.5. Indeed, they are apt to get freſh Wounds every day, Wounds in their Grace, and Wounds in their Peace; Wounds in their Comforts, and Wounds in their Conſciences; Wounds that ſmart ſorely, and which many times bleed, as if they ſhould bleed to death of them: Well, but Chriſt heals all their Wounds, and do but cloſe with him in a Marriage-Covenant, and he will heal all thine too, who ever thou art: He is that good <hi>Samaritan</hi> that has Oyl and Wine, his Blood and Spirit to pour into the Wounds of his People for the healing of them: <hi>By his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> Iſa. 53.5. His Blood and Spirit are a ſovereign Balm, which can heal the deepeſt Wounds and deadlieſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes: His Spouſes find it ſo, <hi>He reſtoreth my
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94533:55"/>Soul,</hi> ſayes <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 23.3. His Soul was ſubject to many ails and infirmities; but Chriſt reſtored him under all: Need we ſay, <hi>Is there no Balm in</hi> Gilead? <hi>is there no Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an there?</hi> Surely there is. Indeed there is none but Chriſt and his Blood that can heal our Wounds. O Soul, why ſhouldeſt thou not cloſe with him that thou mayeſt be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Do not thy Wounds ſtink? and are they not ready to rankle and gangreen? And unleſs Chriſt heals them for thee, muſt thou not unavoidably die of them and periſh for ever? Muſt thou not ſuffer a cutting off, a cutting off from God, a cutting off from Chriſt, a cutting off from Heaven and all happineſs for ever? and wilt thou ſuffer ſuch a cutting off? Wilt thou be content to die and periſh eternally, rather than come to Chriſt for healing?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. He bears all their Burthens: We are commanded to bear one anothers Burthens; eſpecially Husbands ſhould bear the burthens of their Wives: And this Chriſt does, he bears all the Burthens of his Spouſes. Sirs, we all have our Burthens, many and great Burthens, which we labour under, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens within, and Burthens without; Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in the Fleſh, and Burthens in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Burthens that make us groan under them: <hi>Being burthened, we groan,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Burthens that are too heavy for us to bear,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> complained his were, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4. Burthens ſometimes that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94533:55"/>make us a burthen to our ſelves, as <hi>Job</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 7.20. Yea, Burthens that make our very lives a burthen to us: <hi>My Soul is weary of my life,</hi> ſayes <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 10.1. Now how ſhall all theſe Burthens be born? Why Chriſt will bear them all, he bears all the Burthens of all his Spouſes; and if we will cloſe with him in a Marriage-Covenant, there ſhall not that Burthen lie upon us, that he will not bear for us. He bears all his Peoples Burthens two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In a way of Sympathy and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He weeps with all their tears, and ſighs with all their groans: If they are troubled, he grieves; if they are wounded, he bleeds: in all things he bears the other end of the burthen; <hi>In all their afflictions he is afflicted,</hi> Iſa. 63.9. He does <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſuffer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with us; or (as the Apoſtle renders it) <hi>he is touched with the feeling of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> Heb. 4.15. He is deeply ſenſible of all our Burthens, all our Sorrows: Such ſometimes is the caſe with the Saints, that among men they have none to pitty them, and ſympathize with them under their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; as was <hi>David</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.20. But even then Chriſt bears the other end of the Burthen, he pitties them, and ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizes with them, and that according to the weight of their Burthen. And O how ſweet is that? <hi>No matter,</hi> ſayes an Holy Man, <hi>how heavy the burthen be, ſo long as Chriſt bears the other end of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:94533:56"/>2. In a way of Succour and Corroborati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He does not onely bear with them, but alſo he gives them ſtrength to bear, and ſtand up under the burthen: <hi>He puts his everlaſting arms underneath them,</hi> Deut. 33.27. And with the promiſe of this he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages them to caſt their Burthens upon him; <hi>Caſt thy burthen upon the Lord, and be ſhall ſuſtain thee;</hi> ſuccour, and ſupport thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.22. He ſtrengthens and ſuccours them, and that anſwerable to the weight of their Burthen: He gives them great ſtrength for great Burthens, great ſuccours for great Temptations, and ſo makes good his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to them, <hi>not to ſuffer them to be tempted above what they are enabled to bear,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. The poor Soul many times cries out, Oh, I ſhall ſink under the Burthen, 'tis too heavy for me to bear: But, Soul, though it be too heavy for thee; yet 'tis not too heavy for Chriſt to bear, and he bears with thee and for thee: yea, he does not only bear, but in due time he bears away all their Burthens for them: There is not that burthen lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any of his Spouſes, but he ſo bears it, as at laſt to bear it utterly away for them, ſo as they ſhall never need to groan under it more. He has already born the heavieſt burthen of all for them, even the guilt and puniſhment of their ſins; <hi>He bare our ſins in his body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. And again, <hi>He bare the ſin of many,</hi> Iſa. 53.12. And 'tis well for us that he hath born this Burthen; for otherwiſe it muſt neceſſarily have ſunk
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94533:56"/>and cruſht us for ever: We could never have ſtood under it, and as he has born this, ſo he bears, and in due time will bear away all for them: Are their ſins, the iniquities of their holy Things, a burthen to them? Theſe he bears away for them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. Are the reinainders of original Corruption a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to them? Theſe make them groan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; theſe in due time he bears away for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25. Are their conflicts and temptations a burthen to them? Theſe lie heavy upon ſome; in due time he bears theſe away alſo: He turns their Conflicts into Triumphs: Oh how ſhould this comfort the hearts of Saints? And how ſhould it draw and allure ſinners to him? O, Sirs, will you ſink under your burthens, rather than have Chriſt to bear them for you? Oh be not ſo cruel to your own Souls!</p>
               <p n="5">V. He ſweetens all their Afflictions for them: Afflictions they may, and often do meet withal, many and great Afflictions. Chriſt tells us, <hi>That in the World we ſhall have tribulation,</hi> John 16.33. But he ſweetens all for them; he turns their Wormwood into Wine, and therefore at the ſame time, with the ſame breath he ſayes, <hi>In me ye ſhall have peace:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I will ſweeten all your tribulations to you. Chriſt ſweetens his Peoples Afflictions to them two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his preſence with them, and the communications of his love to them under their Afflictions: Chriſt has promiſed to be with his People, and to miniſter comforts to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94533:57"/>them in their afflictions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the Waters, I'l be with thee; and through the Fire, it ſhall not burn thee:</hi> that is, I'le be with thee in all the ſharpeſt Afflictions thou meeteſt withal: They meet with many Afflictions, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Poverty, Reproach, Perſecution, and the like; but Chriſt is with them in all, and ſhews them his love; and this ſweetens all to them. The truth is, Chriſt is never more with his People, and he uſually never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates more of his Love and Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them than when in Affliction: Then uſually 'tis that they have the ſweeteſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of his Boſom, then they have the cleareſt ſights, the fulleſt taſts, the choiceſt and moſt ominent ſealings of his love to them: <hi>Then he leads them into his Banqueting-houſe, and diſplayes the Banner of his Love over them; he ſtayes them with Flaggons, and comforts them with Apples: his leſt hand is under their h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al, and his right hand doth embrace them,</hi> Cant. 2.4, 5, 6. Then he miniſters his ſtrongeſt Conſolations to them, <hi>comforting them in all their tribulations,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.4, 5. The truth is, their ſharpeſt Afflictions are but to prepare them for his ſweeteſt Conſolations; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he therefore oftentimes afflicts them, that he may manifeſt his Love, and miniſter Conſolations to them; according to that of <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.14. <hi>I will allure her into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and there will I ſpeak comfortably to her:</hi> and indeed, as ſtrong Conſolations often times prepare for great Afflictions; ſo great Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94533:57"/>uſually make way for ſtrong Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Afflictions</hi> (ſayes a worthy Divine) <hi>is the Air, in which Chriſts love eſpecially breaths; and Chriſt and the Croſs</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>are ſweet company:</hi> This, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts love and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with his People in their Afflictions, is what turns their night into day, their dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into light, their pains into eaſe, their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows into joys, their loſſes into gains; yea, and Death it ſelf into Life: <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, yet will I fear no evil, becauſe thou art with me,</hi> Pſal. 23.4. It turns a Priſon into a pleaſant Pallace; yea, it turns a fiery Furnace into a delightful Walk; as in the caſe of the three Children, and this experienced Souls find: O how ſweet are Afflictions when Chriſt and his love come with them!</p>
               <p n="2">2. By ſanctifying their Afflictions to them, and working good to their Souls out of all: Sanctifyed Afflictions are ſweet Afflictions; they meet with Afflictions, but Chriſt gives them the ſweet Fruit, and a bleſſed iſſue of them; makes them all work together for good to them, according to that great Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>All things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good to them that love God.</hi> By theſe he proves their Graces, and improves their Experiences; he makes them all to be, as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> ſometimes were to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of God, as ſo many hewers of Wood and drawers of Water to their Faith, to their Comforts, to their Holineſs on Earth, and Happineſs in Heaven: The Faith of this
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94533:58"/>ſweetned all <hi>Jobs</hi> great and heavy Afflictions to him: <hi>When I am tryed,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>I ſhall come forth as Gold,</hi> Job 23.10. Hereby he <hi>tryes their Faith, which is better than Gold,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. Hereby he refines them, and purges away their droſs from them, <hi>Behold, I have refined thee, but not with Silver; I have choſen thee in the Furnace of Affliction:</hi> Or, as you may read it, I have made a choice one of thee in the Furnace of Affliction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.10. Hereby <hi>he makes them partakers of his holineſs,</hi> Heb. 12.10. <hi>By this he purgeth away their iniquity, and taketh away their ſin,</hi> Iſa. 27.9. In ſhort, hereby he humbles them, and ſeals inſtruction to them; hereby he weans them from the World, draws them nearer to himſelf, quickens their hearts in his good wayes, and raiſes them up to higher ſtrains of Grace and pitches in Holineſs, then they were got up to before: Yea, hereby he increaſes their Revenue of Glory, and adds to their Crown in Eternity. <hi>Our light Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are but for a moment,</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>work out for us a far more exceeding and an eternal weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. Thus he ſanctiſies all; and O how doth this ſweeten all? Here is a Croſs, 'tis true, may the Soul ſay, but by this Croſs Chriſt does crucifie me to Sin and the World, he weans me from the Creature, ſets me a longing after Heaven; and ſo long welcome Croſs, how heavy ſoever: Here is an Affliction, 'tis true, and 'tis an heavy one, but by it Chriſt proves and brightens my Graces, and that ſweetens
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94533:58"/>all: <hi>O what owe I</hi> (ſayes <hi>Rutherford</hi>) <hi>to the File and Hammer of my ſweet Lord Jeſus? He hath taught me more</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>by my ſix months impriſonment, then ever I learnt in my nine years paſt Miniſtry. Luther</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>three things made a good Miniſter; Temptation, Affliction, Supplication:</hi> The ſame alſo conduce much to the making of a good Chriſtian: And indeed, 'tis ſeldom that ever a Soul comes to any eminency in Grace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he has been exerciſed with ſanctified Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and Temptations: And doubtleſs, there is many a Soul who may and muſt ſay, That next to Chriſt, his Afflictions have, through his Grace and Bleſſing, been his beſt Mercies. O how ſhould this draw Souls to Chriſt, and allure them into a Marriage-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him? Poor Soul, it may be that which keeps thee from Chriſt, is the fear of what Afflictions thou mayeſt meet with in his wayes: But know, (1.) thou mayeſt meet with Affliction, yea, firſt or laſt thou wilt aſſuredly meet with Affliction, though thou never cloſeſt with Chriſt: Alas, wicked men and unbelievers meet with Troubles and Afflictions, and that even in this World oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: However, to be ſure at laſt, they will have a full Cup, yea, the very dregs of God's Wrath ponred out unto them: They will meet with, and fall under ſoret and more dreadful Afflictions, then any thou canſt meet withal in the way, and for the ſake of Chriſt; for pray conſider, is there any Trouble, any Affliction thou canſt meet withal for Chriſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94533:59"/>like to this, for a man to die in his ſins, to be ſeparated from God for ever, to have infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and eternity combined againſt thee? Is there any Trouble or Affliction like to the torments of the Infernal Pit, and being the object of infinite Wrath for ever? and yet this will be the lot at laſt of all that cloſe not with Chriſt in a Marriage-relation. (2.) What ever Afflictions thou mayeſt meet withal in the way of Chriſt, cloſing with him, he ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens all for thee; and that ſo as that thou wouldeſt not have been without them for a World: Oh ſcare not at the Croſs, but cloſe in with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. He ſubdues all their enemies for them: True, the poor Saints and Spouſes of Chriſt are beſet with Enemies on all hands; they have many Enemies, and mighty Enemies, Enemies within, and Enemies without, and all in a confederacy againſt them to deſtroy them, to deſtroy their Lives, to deſtroy their Graces, to deſtroy their Peace and Comforts, to deſtroy their Souls and Happineſs for ever; all like ſo many roaring Lyons ſeeking to devour them: Well, but Chriſt, who is their Captain as well as their Husband, ſubdues and conquers all for them; and, firſt or laſt, makes them to ſet their feet upon their necks, and triumph over them: He makes them <hi>Conquerors, yea more than Conquerors</hi> over all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. He makes them ſo to conquer them, as ſooner or later to gain by all their conflicts and oppoſitions: Indeed Chriſt has
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94533:59"/>already conquered all his Peoples Enemies for them. The Saints have five great Enemies, <hi>Sin, Self,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> and Chriſt has long ſince conquered them all for them, and by degrees brings them into the joyful triumph of that conqueſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He has conquered Sin for them: He by being made Sin, hath obtained an eternal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over Sin for all his People: Sin is the Saints great Enemy; 'tis that which <hi>wars againſt their Souls,</hi> Rom. 7.23. 1 Pet. 2.11. And indeed this is that which gives all the reſt an advantage againſt them; but even this greateſt Enemy Chriſt has conquered for them: Hence he is ſaid <hi>to have condemned ſin in the fleſh; he for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3. <hi>i. e.</hi> He by being made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Sin, hath killed and ſubdued Sin, paſt a ſentence of Death and Condemnation upon Sin for ever: Hence alſo <hi>our old Man</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed,</hi> Rom. 6.6. Hence alſo he is ſaid <hi>to deſtroy ſin, to take away ſin,</hi> and the like: And how? Why as to the Reign and Power, as well as the Guilt and Curſe of it: And this <hi>Paul,</hi> acted by the Spirit of Faith, could triumph in, even whilſt he was in the ſharpeſt conflicts with ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24, 25. <hi>I thank God through Chriſt,</hi> (ſayes he); For what? why, for victory over, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from that Law of Sin he was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He has conquered Self for them: Self, as well as Sin, is our deadly Enemy: This
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94533:60"/>indeed is a near cloſe Enemy, and moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be ſlain; This is an Enemy that we are too too loth many times to have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet an Enemy which makes woful ſpoyl upon us and our happineſs: I often think of the Speech of an Holy and Learned Divine; <hi>Oh,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>if I could be Maſter of that Houſe-Idol, my Self, my own, my own Will, Wit, Credit, and caſe, how bleſſed were I! O but we have need,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>to be redeemed from our ſelves, rather than from the Devil and the World!</hi> And preſently again he cries out, <hi>O wretched Idol, my Self! When ſhall I ſee the wholly decourted, and Chriſt wholly put in thy room?</hi> And who that have any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with themſelves, do not find cauſe to cry out in like manner? Oh this Self, this wretched Self, how great an Enemy is it! Well, but this Chriſt hath conquered, and cloſing with him, thou ſhalt by degrees find it to die and fall under thee. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>nevertheleſs I live, yet not I,</hi> Gal. 2.20. He had an I, a Self which ruled in him; but by Chriſt 'twas cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and ſlain for him, and he was a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer over it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He has conquered the World for them: Take the World in what notion you will, and 'tis in one reſpect or other an Enemy to the Saints; the Men of the World, the Things of the World, the Frowns of the World, the Flatteries of the World, they all one way or other fight againſt them, and are Enemies to them. The World, as well as Sin and Self,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94533:60"/>is a mortal Enemy to them: But this Enemy alſo Chriſt has ſubdued and conquered for them, and he has told them ſo much for their comfort, under the oppoſitions they meet with from it; <hi>Job.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Be of good chear, I have overcome the World,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>q. d.</hi> the World is your Enemy, but 'tis a conquered Enemy; 'twill moleſſ and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you, but it ſhall not be able to hurt you, for, have conquered it for you. And as he has conquered it for us, ſo he will enable us, cloſing with him, by Faith to conquer it: ſo 1 John 5.4. <hi>This is the victory which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh the World, even our Faith:</hi> The World ſhall not alwayes annoy and infeſt the Saints.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He has conquered the Devil, yea all the Devils in Hell for them: The Devil is the Enemy of the Saints, and indeed he is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable one; an Adverſary that <hi>goes about like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. He is a ſubtil, a potent, a malicious, a cruel, and an indefatigable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: But ſo formidable an Enemy as he is, Chriſt hath conquered him for them; hence he is ſaid <hi>to have deſtroyed the Devil; he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of fleſh and blood, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death; that is, the Devil,</hi> Heb. 2.14. <hi>and to have ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, and to have made a ſhew of them openly on his Croſs, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over them,</hi> Col. 2.15. dragging them at his Charriot-Wheels; as was the manner ſometimes for Conquerers to deal by their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94533:61"/>vanquiſhed Enemies: The ſum is, that he hath made a compleat and glorious conqueſt over all the Devils in Hell for Believers: He has conquered them even to triumph: Chriſt has conquered the Devil for his Spouſes, as to his ruling, reigning, and commanding power, and he will, and does conquer him at laſt, yea ſpeedily, as to his tempting, vexing, and ſeducing power; <hi>The God of Peace ſhall tread Satan under your feet ſhortly,</hi> Rom. 16.20. Shortly, Soul, the Devil ſhall vex thee no more, moleſt thee no more, infeſt and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy thee by his temptations no more.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He has conquered Death for them: Death is an Enemy. and 'tis the <hi>laſt Enemy that is to be deſtroyed,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. and in it ſelf conſidered, a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Enemy 'tis, 'tis <hi>the King of terrors,</hi> Job 18.14. But this Enemy hath Chriſt conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all his; He has taken away all its kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power, its ſting and curſe, in ſo much that they may holily triumph over it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in its approach; the Apoſtle did ſo, 1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57. <hi>Death</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in victory, O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? The ſting of Death is Sin, the ſtrength of Sin is the Law, but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> O what a triumph does he here act over Death through the conqueſt Chriſt has gotten over it for him? Truly, this Enemy is ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by him for them, that 'tis become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a friend to them; and they can, when
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94533:61"/>in a right ſpirit, embrace it as ſuch, and long for it as ſuch: Chriſt by Death has unſtung Death, and in a ſort undeatht it: Thus Chriſt has conquered all his Peoples Enemies, and they being made one with him in a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Covenant, all his Victories are theirs, and his Conqueſts theirs, and they are conquerers over all in him; and oh how ſweet, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging is this! and how ſhould it win Souls to a cloſe with him! poor Soul, thou ſeeſt thy ſelf environed with Enemies, thou art hard beſet on all hands, legions of Luſts and Devils, attended with Self, Death, and the World, oppoſe themſelves againſt thee; and thou art often crying out as <hi>David</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother caſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.19. <hi>I am weak, and theſe men, the Sons of</hi> Zerviah, <hi>are too ſtrong for me:</hi> yea, thou art ready to ſay of them, as he ſometimes in his unbelief did of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 27.1. <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of</hi> Saul: Alas, I am a weak, nothing-Creature, and am unable to grapple with the leaſt of all mine Enemies; and how then ſhall I ſtand up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them all? ſurely I ſhall periſh by them at laſt: Well Soul, but know for thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that all thine Enemies are conquered by Chriſt, and though they are too ſtrong for thee, yet they are not too ſtrong for Chriſt to grapple with, and make thee a conquerer over. When the Prophets Servant ſaw what a great and formidable <hi>Hoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the City,</hi> he cryed out, <hi>Alas! my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, what ſhall we do?</hi> And what did his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter anſwer him? <hi>Fear not</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94533:62"/>that be with us, be more than they that be with them,</hi> 2 King. 6.15, 16. So poor Soul, when thou conſidereſt what great and formidable Enemies do compaſs thee about, thou cryeſt out to one and another; Alas, Sir, what ſhall I do? But I would ſay to thee as the Prophet to his Servant; Fear not, there is more with thee than with them; thou haſt Chriſt with thee, to ſight and overcome all for thee; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chear up, give up thy ſelf unto him; and the victory over <hi>Sin, Self, World, Death, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> and all is thine for ever. Oh, who would not have ſuch an Husband?</p>
               <p>VII. He minds and manages all their Concerns for them: 'Tis the part of an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to mind and manage the Concerns of his Wife, and to have a natural care both of her and them: And thus 'tis with Chriſt, He manages all his Peoples Concerns, and that in Heaven, on Earth, and in their own Souls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He minds and manages all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns in Heaven for them: Their Affairs lie much in Heaven, their Buſineſs there is great; and Chriſt their Husband minds all, and tranſacts all for them, and that faithfully; Indeed he went thither on purpoſe to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act their Affairs for them: Hence he is ſaid <hi>to have entered not into the holy place made with hands, but into Heaven it-ſelf, there to appear in the preſence of God for them,</hi> Heb. 9.24. Hence alſo he is ſaid <hi>to be an Advocate with the Father for them,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1. He pleads with the Father for them: Have they a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94533:62"/>to preſent to the Father for this or the other Mercy? He preſents and prefers it for them: He takes all their Prayers, and ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles them with his own Blood perſumes them with the odours of his own incenſe, and then tenders them to the Father with his own hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. <hi>beg.</hi> We pray very brokenly, but he mends our Prayers; yea oftentimes, when we can't pray, when we can't ſpeak for our ſelves, he ſpeaks for us, and prefers our Petitions for us: Are there Charges and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations brought in againſt them, either by Satan the Accuſer of the Brethren on the one hand, or by the Law and Juſtice of God, which are daily wronged and violated on the other hand? Why Chriſt interpoſes for them, he anſwers all, and invalidates all, <hi>he rebukes Satan,</hi> Zach. 3.2. In the firſt verſe we find <hi>Joſhua ſtanding before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan ſtanding at his right hand to reſiſt</hi> (or accuſe) <hi>him;</hi> and in the ſecond verſe we have Chriſt ſharply rebuking Satan for his accuſation; <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Satan, the Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath choſen Jeruſalem rebuke thee:</hi> And as he rebukes Satan, ſo he ſatisfies the Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Father: Hence he is ſaid <hi>to make interceſſion for them,</hi> and that to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of all thoſe counterpleas, which Law or Juſtice can put in againſt them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. Have they ſinned, and do they need a new pardon, need to have things ſet right and even between God and them afreſh? This alſo Chriſt does for them; <hi>If any man
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94533:63"/>ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, Chriſt Jeſus the Righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1, 2. While they through weakneſs and temptation are ſinning on Earth, he out of his Grace and Love is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Father for them in Heaven: Thus he minds all their Concerns in Heaven for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He minds and manages all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns on Earth for them: The Saints have their Aſſairs and Concerns on Earth among men, as well as in Heaven with the Father, and Chriſt their Husband minds and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts all theſe likewiſe for them. Indeed he is ever mindful of them, and at work for them, <hi>viz.</hi> to do them good, and to promote their intereſt: Hence, ſayes he, <hi>the Father worketh hitherto, and I work,</hi> Joh. 5.17. I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at work for your good. Are they wronged and oppreſſed by Enemies? He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges all their wrongs: Hence he is ſaid <hi>to reprove Kings for their ſakes,</hi> Pſal. 105.14. and elſewhere, to plead their cauſe againſt their Enemies, and the like. Do they need de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and ſalvation out of troubles and diſtreſſes? He <hi>brings ſalvation to them,</hi> Iſa. 63.9. Do they need conduct and guidance through their diſſiculties and temptations in the Wilderneſs of the World? He leads and guides them, <hi>He leads</hi> Joſeph, <hi>like a flock,</hi> Pſal. 80.1. and elſewhere, <hi>I will guide thee with mine eye:</hi> He carries them through all their ſtraits, and all their difficulties, and even when he ſeems moſt to forget them, even then
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94533:63"/>he is ever mindful of them, and of their concerns: For <hi>he hath graven th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="3">3. He minds and manages all their concerns for them in their own Souls: The Saints have many and great Concerns to be minded within them, concerns of great moment and importance; and, were they to be minded and managed onely by themſelves, they would make but poor work: O! but Chriſt their Husband minds and manages all theſe likewiſe for them; and to be ſure they can't miſcarry in his hand: He gives them his Spirit to work all their works in them and for them: He obſerves what Grace, what Strength, what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, what Comfort they ſtand in need of, and by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Miniſters all to them: Hence he is ſaid <hi>to give them Grace and Mercy to help in a time of need,</hi> ſeaſonable ſupplies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. and to be both <hi>the Author and Finiſher of their Faith,</hi> Heb. 12.2. He minds and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, how the great Work goes on in their Souls, and he takes care for the proſpering and perſecting of it: O how ſhould this draw us to Chriſt, and encourage us to accept of the offers of hs love?</p>
               <p>VIII. He injoynters them in eternal Life and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Husbands uſe to make Joynters to their Wives, they entitle them to ſuch or ſuch Lands and Inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: So Chriſt injoynters all his Spouſes in no leſs than eternal Life and Bleſſedneſs: He makes over a great Joynter to them, Glory, a weight of Glory, <hi>an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and an eternal weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. <hi>An Inheritance in Light,</hi> Col. 1.12. <hi>An Inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. A Kingdom, an everlaſting Kingdom, <hi>an everlaſting Kingdom prepared for them before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World,</hi> Matth. 25.34. <hi>A Crown of Life,</hi> Rev. 2.10. <hi>A Crown of Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. <hi>A Crown of Glory, which never fades,</hi> never, withers,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94533:64"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. The truth is, he endows them with all his Riches, with all his Treaſures, with all his Dignities, with all the Priviledges of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s Houſe, with all the Purchaſes of his Blood, with all the Bleſſings of his Love, with all the Treaſures of Heaven, with all the Glories of Eternity: Look, whatever is in the Promiſe, whatever is in the Covenant, whatever is in the glorious Counſel of Election: Look, whatever the Preſence of God; the Face of God, the Boſom of God can afford: Look, whatever the heart of God could give, the Wiſdom of God contrive, the Power of God produce, or the Blood of God purchaſe; that, all that does Chriſt injoynter his People in. O Sirs, how ſhould this draw and allure us to Chriſt! Is Heaven and eternal Life worth nothing? Are all the Glories of Eternity of no value? O who are you, that Chriſt ſhould be willing to inſtate you into all this? In your ſelves you are lying in the lap and boſom of Hell, Heirs of Wrath and Condemnation, in danger every moment of ſinking into the infernal Pit: But loe! Chriſt comes and makes love to you, and if you will accept of him, he will entitle you unto Life and Bleſſedneſs, to ſuch things <hi>as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive of,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. Take him therefore, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, into your moſt intimate embraces. Thus you ſee in part, what great things Chriſt does for his Spouſes: Now will you accept of him, or will you not? May I not ſay to you, as <hi>Saul</hi> ſometimes did to his Servants? <hi>Hear now, will the Son of</hi> Jeſſe <hi>give to every one of you Fields and Vineyards, and make you Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of thouſands?</hi> 1 Sam. 22.7. So will <hi>Sin,</hi> or the <hi>World,</hi> or the <hi>Law,</hi> to which you are naturally wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, do ſuch great things for you as Chriſt will? Will theſe pay your Debts for you, ſupply your Wants for you, heal your Wounds for you, and the like?

               <p>SUrely Chriſt is the beſt Husband, and none can do ſuch great things as he for his Spouſes, which renders an Eſpouſal to him very deſirable: but will he take ſuch as we are into ſo near a Relation with him? has he any mind, any heart to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? any mind, any heart? his heart is ſet upon nothing more, then an Eſpouſal with Sinners; he is not only content to admit Sinners coming to him, but his Soul longs after them: never did the moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Lover more long for an Eſpouſal between him and his Beloved, than Chriſt does for an Eſpouſal between himſelf and Sinners; and becauſe Love is the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of Love, and the moſt powerful attractive; in order to the more effectual drawing and alluring of your Souls to Chriſt, I ſhall a little in a few particulars open my ſweet Lords heart to you in this buſineſs: And O that the reports of his Love to you, and his willingneſs to Eſpouſe you to himſelf, might draw your hearts out a little in Love to him, and work you into a willingneſs to be Eſpouſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such is the heart of Chriſt, and ſo ſet
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94533:65"/>upon an Eſpouſal with Sinners, that he willingly became incarnate, bled, and dyed in order hereunto; and oh, how ſhould this draw us to him? Should you ſee a Man do ſome great Act of ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and abaſement, and withal freely ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his Life in order to his obtaining ſuch or ſuch an one to his Wife, you would eaſily conclude, that his heart was much ſet upon an Eſpouſal with her: Lo then! Chriſt has greatly denyed and abated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he became incarnate, and not only freely ventured, but laid down his Life in order to an Eſpouſal between himſelf and Sinners; and how much then muſt his heart be in the buſineſs?</p>
               <p n="1">1. He became incarnate in order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; had not Chriſt been incarnate we could never poſſibly have been Eſpouſed unto him, nor have enjoyed conjugal Communion with him: but that we might be capable of, and arrive unto ſuch an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, he who in himſelf was the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son, freely became incarnate, aſſumed humane Nature into Union with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon: hence 'tis ſaid, that <hi>the Word was made fleſh:</hi>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94533:67"/>not only to ſerve, but even bleed, and dye for them in order hereunto. Oh, Sirs, behold, and wonder; Chriſt comes from Heaven, quits his Throne, leaves the boſome of his Father, in which he had with inſinite delight lain from Eternity! behold and wonder, the Lord of Life dyes, the God of Bleſſing was made a Curſe.

               <p>How earneſtly does he call, and invite them to himſelf; 'tis not a cold offer or a ſlight motion onely, that he makes to them, but he moves, and offers, calls, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites with all earneſtneſs and importunity: <hi>Hoe, every one, that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, come ye, yea, come,</hi> Iſa. 55: 1. and again, <hi>the Spirit and the Bride ſay, come; and let him, that is a thirſt, come, Rev.</hi> 22.17.</p>

               <p>How freely and openly does he reveal and offer himſelf to them? The offer Chriſt makes is not a Limited offer; but general and extenſive to all; nor is it an offer made upon hard and ſevere terms; but upon terms of Grace &amp; Love: <hi>Look unto me, and be ſaved, all ye ends of the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 45.22. <hi>Hot, every

               <p>How affectionately does he beſeech, and intreat them? The tender trembling Child cannot more affectionately intreat and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech his offended Father to ſpare him, and be reconciled unto him, then Chriſt does intreat and beſeech offending Sinners to be Eſpouſed to him, and be made happy by him for ever: <hi>Now then, we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God:</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20.

Now he ſets his Beauty, Riches, and Glory before them, thereby to draw and allure them, anon he drops a little Myrrhe upon the handle of the Lock; he gives them ſome little taſte and feeling of his Grace and Love, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to draw and allure them: Now he ſweetly inſinuates his Love to them; he tells them, how much his heart is upon them, what great things he has done and ſuffered for them, and how that he has no deſign upon them, but to make them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for ever: anon he lets them ſee how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely happy a Marriage-Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him would make them; he lets in ſome ſmall glimpſes of Heaven and Glory upon them; he opens the Treaſures of his Covenant and Kingdome to them: And all this to draw and allure them to himſelf; and over, and above all this, he ever and anon comes, and, as it were, takes the Soul aſide, and by the ſtill voyce of his Spirit, makes love to him: Come, poor Soul (ſays he) look upon thy bleeding, dying

Thus he ſweetly woos and ſollicits them for their Love and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of him: Now, Soul, does he thus woo thee? And wilt thou refuſe him? If ſo, know, that the time of Love will not alwayes laſt: yea, and the time will come, when, though <hi>thou calleſt, and cryeſt, yet he will not hear:</hi> let me therefore ſay to thee, as <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>Corinthians: Receive not the Grace of God in vain; for behold, now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

Such is the heart of Chriſt, and ſo ſet upon an Eſpouſal with Sinners, that he not only thus woos them, but alſo waits long upon them, often renews the offers of his Love to them, and puts up many horrid affronts and provocations at their hands; if at laſt he may prevail with them.

Such is the heart of Chriſt, and ſo ſet upon an Eſpouſal with ſinners; as that he has laid himſelf under Bonds to receive them, and accept of them, in caſe they are willing to be Eſpouſed to him; and what greater Diſcovery of his heart then this? Should a young man lay himſelf under Bonds to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch or ſuch a Woman, though as yet ſhe hated him, and were utterly averſe from him; you would ſurely conclude, that his heart was much ſet upon a Match with her: and truly this is no more then Chriſt the Lord of Glory hath done: he is become bound to Marry poor Sinners to himſelf, yea though at preſent they hate him, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together averſe from him; yet in caſe they ſhall at laſt be willing to cloſe with him, he is become bound to receive them: he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bound both to the Father, &amp; to them.</p>

And this makes thee fear, that he will now have nothing to do with thee: And truly ſoul, this is ſad, very ſad, hereby Chriſt has loſt much Glory, which thou mighteſt have brought him; hereby thou haſt loſt much ſweet communion, which thou might. eſt have enjoyed; hereby Chriſt's heart has been much grieved, which might have been prevented; and hereby the work is made much more difficult, then at firſt it was, thy heart being grown more hard, and Corruptions more ſtrong: Thus 'tis every way very ſad, that thou haſt thus neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and refuſed Chriſt, but yet neither ſhall this ſtand between him and thee in caſe thou art willing to be Eſpouſed to him: For this ſee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Wiſdom Cryeth without, ſhe uttereth her voice in the Streets, ſhe cryeth in the chief place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in the openings of the gates, in the City ſhe uttereth her words, ſaying: How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity?

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94533:77"/>obſerve, Chriſt had offered himſelf, and his love to them, but they had refuſed him and it, yea, they had refuſed long, and refuſed with much contempt: <hi>How long ye Simple ones will ye love Simplicity?</hi> &amp;c. They ſcorn'd the offers of Chriſt and, his Love, and yet here he renewes thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to them, wherein he tells them, that none of all their refuſals ſhould prejudice their acceptance with him, in caſe they are willing to be his: <hi>Turn ye at my reproof, behold I will pour out my</hi> Spirit, &amp;c. And ſoul, do not the moſt refuſe long; and ſtand it out long againſt the offers of Chriſt and his grace, e're they cloſe with him, who yet are received &amp; embraced by him? Be not therefore diſcouraged, poor ſoul, becauſe of thy former neglects and refuſals of Chriſt, but throw thy ſelf into the Arms of his love, which thou wilt certainly find wide open to receive, and Embrace thee.</p>

Indeed there is never a Soul now in Heaven, but was by Nature every way as vile, ſinful, and unworthy of Chriſt, as thou: they lay under the ſame pollution, they wallowed in the ſame Blood, they were filled with the ſame Spirit of oppoſition againſt God and his wayes, that thou doſt, and art; yea, and multitudes of them were as vile and ſinful by practice alſo, as thou; they Acted out the ſin and enmity of their Natures as highly againſt God and Chriſt, as thou haſt done; and yet theſe Chriſt received,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94533:79"/>elſe they had not been in Heaven. In a word, Heaven (as one obſerves) is an Houſe full of the Miracles of Chriſt's free Grace: There's Idolatrous <hi>Maniſſeth</hi> among the true Worſhippers of God: There's oppreſſing <hi>Zacheus</hi> among the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect: There's Blaſphemous <hi>Paul</hi> among the Hoſt of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Lauding, Praiſing, and ſinging <hi>Halelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs</hi> to God and the Lamb; and there is <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> that had ſeven Devils among the Saints of the moſt High, who are filled even to overflowing with the ſeven Spirits of God.

               <p n="6">6. Such is the heart of Chriſt, and ſo ſet upon an Eſpouſal with ſinners, as that, he delights and rejoyces in nothing more hardly, then in the Nuptials between him and them; and oh, how ſhould this draw and allure us to him? Should you ſee a Young Man rejoycing in the ſenſe of an Eſpouſal between himſelf, and ſuch, or ſuch an one whom he Loved, you might well conclude, that his heart was much upon her: and is it not thus here? Chriſt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94533:79"/>rejoyces in the ſight and ſenſe of an Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal between himſelf and ſinners, and how much does this Argue his heart to be in the buſineſs? This I will give you in three propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is what he rejoyced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted himſelf in the thoughts of from all Eternity: thus much he himſelf tells us, <hi>Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then, namely, from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, <hi>was I by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoycing alwayes before him, rejoycing in the habitable parts of the Earth, and my delights were with the Sons of Men:</hi> Theſe are Chriſt's words, and in them he tells you where he was, and what he had been doing from Eternity, he was with the Father, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced before him; but what did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in? truly, next to his Father and himſelf, his rejoycing was in the habitable parts of the Earth, and his delights were with the Sons of Men: He delighted himſelf in the thoughts of ſaving poor ſinners, and Eſpouſing them unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in order thereunto: Oh, how much does this Argue his heart to be in the buſineſs?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As he thus delighted and rejoyced in the thoughts of it before hand; ſo when at any time a poor Soul is Actually Eſpouſed to him, then he rejoyces afreſh, and is delighted afreſh: Hence the day of Eſpouſals is called <hi>the day of the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart,</hi> Cant. 3.11. the

'Tis a great grief and trouble to Chriſt, that which wounds his very ſoul, when having wooed poor Sinners, and time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time made Love to them, they not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are Shy of him, and will not cloſe with them in a Marriage-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: Hence he complains, as he doe; <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.41. <hi>You will not come to me that you might have life, and Mat.</hi> 23.37. <hi>O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Jeruſalem, how often would I have gathered thee, and thou wouldſt not:</hi> He ſpeaks complainingly, &amp; as one grieved at heart, at their neglects of him, yea this was that which made him Weep as he did over Jeruſalem <hi>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94533:80"/>Diſhonour upon his name, poures great contempt upon his Grace, and is directly contrary to the whole deſign of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, as mediator, and ſo cannot but be grievous to him: So on the contrary, when ſouls come freely in, and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Marriage-Relation to him, this glads and rejoyces his heart; Oh how ſhould this draw ſouls to him? Sinner, why may not this day be made the day of the gladneſs of Chriſt's heart, by being a day of Eſpouſals between him and thee? He has ſeen many a day of grief of heart, and trouble of heart, becauſe of thy ſtanding out againſt him, and refuſing the offers of his Love: Oh now let him ſee one day of joy of heart and gladneſs of heart by thy cloſing up with him in a Marriage-Covenant!</p>
               <p n="3">3. As Chriſt delights and rejoyces when ſouls are Eſpouſed to him; ſo being Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed to him, he delights and rejoyces in this Eſpouſal for ever: Men Marry ſuch or ſuch, and they rejoyce therein at preſent, but their joy does not laſt: 'Tis otherwiſe with Chriſt, he did rejoyce in the thoughts of it from all Eternity, he does rejoyce in the being and accompliſhment of it here in time, and he will rejoyce in the conſummation of it in Heaven for ever; the truth is, his joy is not compleat, till the Marriage be compleat; nor will his joy ever end, till that end, which will never be (as in its place may be ſhewn)
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94533:81"/>Thus you ſee a little what Chriſt's lieart is, and how much ſet upon this Buſineſs; as well as what manner of Husband he is, and what great things he does for all his Eſpouſes; and now after all what do you ſay?

               <p>AN Eſpouſal with Chriſt, what more ſweet? what more deſirable? And who that underſtands himſelf, would not covet it, before any thing this World affords? no Husband like Chriſt, and no happineſs like to an Eſpouſal to him, but the queſtion is, how we may attain hereunto: Truly, ſoul, the work is great, and 'tis the Divine Spirit alone that does and can tie the Marriage-Knot between Chriſt and thee; but he works in this, as well as in other caſes, in and by the uſe of means; and there are ſeveral things highly incumbent upon thee, and which muſt be attended by thee, as ever thou wouldſt attain to an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with this Bleſſed Eſpouſal.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Would'ſt thou be Eſpouſed to Chriſt? Then labour to be deeply Senſible of thine utter eſtrangement from him by nature, as alſo of thy woful miſery by reaſon of that eſtrangement. A deep ſenſe of our Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement from Chriſt, and of our miſery by reaſon of that eſtrangement, is one good ſtep towards a conjugal-Union and relation to him, and without the one, we are never
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94533:82"/>like to attain unto the other. Labour, therefore for this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Labour to be deeply ſenſible of your eſtrangment from Chriſt by nature: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we are all ſtrangers to Chriſt, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to all conjugal-Union &amp; Communion with him: We know not what any ſuch thing means: As 'twas with the Epheſians, ſo 'tis with us all by nature, they were and we are <hi>without Chriſt in the World,</hi> Eph. 2.12. And not onely <hi>without him, but</hi> alſo <hi>far from him</hi> as it followes, &amp;. 13. I may truly ſay to every natural man and woman in this, as <hi>Peter</hi> did to <hi>Simon</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Acts.</hi> 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>1. <hi>Thou haſt neither part nor Lot in this matter;</hi> Thou knoweſt not what Union and Communion which this ſweet Lord means: Yea, not onely are we by nature eſtranged from Chriſt; but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over we are at Enmity with him, and fill'd with hatred and oppoſition againſt him; we, as thoſe mentioned, <hi>Lu.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Do hate him, and would not have him to reign over us:</hi> Naturally we are at Enmity with Chriſt, and with every thing that is his, with his Perſon, with his Preſence, with his Spirit, with his Kingdome, with his Lawes and Ordinances, with his Graces, with his Righteouſneſs, and the like: His perſon is too holy for us, his preſence, too pure, his Spirit too convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, his Kingdom to Spiritual, his Laws and Ordinances too ſtrict, his Graces too bright, his Righteouſneſs to oppoſite to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94533:82"/>ſelf; and ſo we hate all, and are at Enmity with all: Yea, we are at Enmity with the very way of Life and Salvation by him: <hi>Touching the Goſpel they are Enemies,</hi> ſayes the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> which is ſpoken of the Jews, but true of all by nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. We would live, but not by Chriſt: We would be Saved, but not by Chriſt: Thus naturally we are all eſtranged from him; and thus high does our eſtrangment riſe, which we muſt be deeply ſenſible of, if ever we get Union and Communion in a conjugal way with him: Therefore work this a little upon your thoughts, till you find your heart begin to bleed and relent over it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Labour to be deeply ſenſible of your exceeding great miſery by reaſon of this eſtrangment: As we are all naturally with out Chriſt; ſo our miſery herein is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great: So much the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> holds forth, in the place before quoted, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.12. Where he ſpeakes of our being <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> as our miſery; yea, as the ſpring and Foundation of all our miſery; and therefore that is firſt mentioned: the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians were, and we are (as he there tells us) <hi>without the Covenant, without hope, and without God in the World;</hi> miſery enough for any Soul to lye under; and the inlet and Foundation of all is, their and our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>without Chriſt:</hi> As to have Chriſt (ſays a learned Interpreter upon this place) is the Foundation of all good; ſo, to be
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94533:83"/>without Chriſt is the beginning and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all evil; an inlet into all woe and miſery, and what leaves us in a moſt deplored ſtate for ever: Take a taſte, and but a taſte of this your miſery, and then work the ſenſe of it upon your own Souls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Being without Chriſt, you are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all good, you are without Life, without Grace, without Peace without Pardon, without Comfort, without Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, without Heaven, without Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>without Hope, and without God</hi> (as you have it in the ſame place) <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. without the Favour of God, without the Preſence of God, without the Life of God, without the Image of God, without the Spirit of God, and being thus without God, you are without all true good, and true happineſs: According to the old and true Maxim <hi>

               <p n="2">2. Being without Chriſt, you are in Bondage to ſin and Satan, which is the worſt Bondage in the World. Naturally all are the Slaves and Vaſſalls of theſe cruell Lords: Hence we are ſaid <hi>to fulfill the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils luſts, Je.</hi> 8, 44. and <hi>as the luſts of the Devil, ſo the wills and luſts of the ſleſh, Epe.</hi> 2.2. <hi>to be the ſervants of ſin, to ſerve divers luſts, and pleaſures,</hi> and the like: And as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all are thus in Bondage to ſin and the Devil; ſo there is no redemption from this Bondage but by Chriſt, and that in a way
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94533:83"/>of Union with him: <hi>If the Son therefore ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed,</hi> ſaith he himſelf to the Jews, <hi>Je.</hi> 8.36. They were Glorying in their privilidge, that they were <hi>Obrahams</hi> ſeed, and never were in Bondage to any man: True, ſayes Chriſt, but ye are in a worſe Bondage then a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to man, in Bondage to ſin, in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to your luſts: For <hi>he that committeth ſin is the ſervant of ſin:</hi> and this Bondage none but the Son can free you from; and therefore, untill freed by him, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under it. O how ſore a Bondage is this? To be under the command of ſin, to be at the beck of every baſe, unclean luſt, and to be carried <hi>Captive by the Devil at his will:</hi> This is ſuch a Bondage as that the Bondage of Iſrael under their task-makers in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the bondage of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſlaves, who are kept at the Oar and Galley is freedom to it: as to ſerve Chriſt is the greateſt liberty, ſo to ſerve ſin is the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Bondage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Being without Chriſt, and Union with Chriſt, you are rejected of God: <hi>Know ye not</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle:) <hi>that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Chriſt be in you, ye are Reprohates;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Know ye not?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, 'tis a moſt clear, manifeſt, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truth, that unleſs you have Union with Chriſt, you are Reprobates; <hi>i. e.</hi> you are unapproved of God, you are out of his Favour, both your perſons and ſervices are rejected by him: To the ſame purpoſe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94533:84"/>is that, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22. Where we read, of 2 Mothers, and 2 Sons: The two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were types of the 2 Covenants, the Covenant of works, and the Covenant of Grace, as appears by <hi>v.</hi> 24. The 2 Sons are types of 2 ſorts of perſons living in the Church; one born after the fleſh, the other by promiſe; one belonging to the firſt, the other to the ſecond Covenant: Well, what's the condition of theſe? Why, the one is in a ſtate of rejection, and the other of acceptation: They, that belong to the ſecond Covenant are owned, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced in the arms of Love; the other are caſt out (as you may ſee in the ſequel of the Chap:) Beſides, all our acceptation with God is in Chriſt, and through Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. Out of him therefore we are in a ſtate of rejection: O, how ſad does this ſpeak your condition to be? for men, yea, for good men to reject, and diſown us, is what may be born, eſpecially when God ownes, and ſmiles: But for God to diſown, and reject us, this is terrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, though all the World ſhould own us, and ſmile upon us: How terrible is that word? <hi>Reprobate ſilver ſhall men call them: for the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> Jer. 6.30— If God ownes, and ſmiles, 'tis no matter who frowns; but if he frowns, and rejects, who can own or ſmile to the relief of the Soul?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Being without Chriſt, you are under the Law, and ſo under the curſe; and how
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94533:84"/>ſad is this? as there are but 2 Covenants, the old, and the new; and but 2 heads of thoſe Covenants; the firſt, or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam; ſo all men do belong to, and are found in the one or the other of theſe: Whilſt therefore you are ſtrangers to Chriſt, you are under the Law, and being under the Law you are under the curſe: For, ſayes the <hi>Apoſtle, As many as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law are under the curſe: For it is Written, curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are Written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3, 10. The Law has no pitty, no ſparing for offenders; But for every breach thereof lays the Soul under the curſe: Now, we have all broken the Law, we all broke it in Adam, being in him as in an head; and we have all broken it 10. Thouſand times over in our own perſons; and by both are fallen under the curſe thereof: And, Soul, doſt thou know what the curſe of the Law means? It carries in it Death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for ever: Being under the Law, we are curſed in our perſons, and curſed in our comforts: The wrath of God lies upon our ſouls, and the curſe of God is in all our enjoyments, our very. Bleſſings are accur'ſt to us, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2. We read in Scripture of <hi>the people of God</hi>'s <hi>curſe;</hi> and thou art one of them, Soul, who ever thou art, that art out of Chriſt: O how woeful, how deplorable a condition is this!</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:94533:85"/>5. Being without Chriſt, and eſtranged from Chriſt, you lie under the guilt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſins, which you alone muſt bear for ever? 'tis in, and by Chriſt alone, that Souls are Diſcharg'd from the guilt of ſin: And who are they, whom he diſcharges from guilt; but ſuch as are found in him, are under a Marriage-Covenant with him? thoſe <hi>his Blood cleanſes from all ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.7. and <hi>in him have they redemption through his Blood, even the for giveneſs of ſin,</hi> Eph. 1.7. As for others, he tells them plainly <hi>they ſhall die in their ſins,</hi> Jo. 8.24. O, how ſad a condition is this? Soul, thou art guilty of multitudes of ſins, the leaſt of which has evil enough in it to damn thee eternally: Thou haſt thouſands, &amp; 10 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Scarlet, Crimſon ſins, ſins cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with black and crying aggravations, lying upon thee; and to have all theſe in the full weight of the guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them charged upon thee by the great God for ever, how miſerable does this ſpeak thy condition to be.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Being eſtranged from Chriſt, you are under a neceſſity of ſinning, and ſo of great'ning your own damnation daily: A man out of Chriſt does do, can do nothing but ſin; for <hi>he is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor can he be, Rom.</hi> 8.8. And as he is ever ſinning, ſo he is ever <hi>treaſuring up wrath unto himſelf, Ro.</hi> 2.5. O, how ſad a condition is this? This is <hi>Dura ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitas</hi> (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls it) and ſpeaks a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94533:85"/>mans condition to be very doleful: To be always ſinning againſt God, and alwayes treaſuring up wrath to a man's own Soul, this is next to Hell, in ſome ſort worſe. To give you thee Sum of all,</p>
               <p>Being eſtranged from Chriſt, you have nothing to ſatisfie Divine juſtice, which is ready to ſeize upon you; nothing to pacifie Divine wrath, which is ready to break forth againſt you; nothing to ſtand between Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin revenges and your ſinful ſouls: What ſhall I ſay? you have many accuſers, and by them many heavy charges brought in againſt you, and being without Chriſt, you have no Advocate to plead your cauſe, none to ſpeak a good word in Heaven for you: and is not that ſad? you are deeply in debt, you owe your 10 thouſand tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to Divine juſtice, and being without Chriſt, you have nothing to pay, but are in danger of being caſt into the Priſon of eternal darkneſs, whence there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: And is not that ſad? you are under an obligation to much Duty, and being without Chriſt, you are under an utter impoſſibility of performing any of it acceptably: You are under a judgment of condemnation, and being without Chriſt you have nothing that can ſecure you one day, one hour, one moment more on this ſide everlaſting Burnings: and O how ſad, and miſerable is this! Thus you ſee, both your eſtrangment from Chriſt, and alſo your miſery (in part) by reaſon of

He ſhall convince the World of ſin; becauſe they believe not in me; <hi>i.e. de illo magno &amp; grandi incredulitatis peccato:</hi> He ſhall convince them of that grand ſin of unbelief (as a learned man expounds it) as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, he ſhall make men ſee the black and hainous nature of the ſin of rejecting me, and my Love: He ſhall humble them for it, and ſet them a bleeding over it: This ſin of rejecting Chriſt, ſome of the Shcool-men have called <hi>Maximum peccatum,</hi> the greateſt ſin of all: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, next to the unpardonable ſin, what greater? This is a ſin moſt directly, and immediately againſt Chriſt and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: O for a vile wretched ſinner to ſhut the door of his ſoul againſt Chriſt, the King of Glory, and deny him entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to refuſe and reject the free and frequent offers of him and his Love, how great a ſin muſt this be? And ſoul, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee the better of it, and make thee the more afraid of it, I ſhall ſuggeſt a few conſiderations to thee, holding forth a little of its black and horred evil.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Conſider, that the neglect and refuſal of Chriſt &amp; his Love is a ſin againſt a ſpecial &amp; eminent command, and therefore a great &amp; crying ſin: The greater and more eminent: the command is, which we tranſgreſs and ſin againſt; the greater our ſin and guilt is in tranſgreſſing that command: Now, God does not onely command us to receive
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94533:87"/>and embrace Chriſt and his Love; but this command of his is a great, ſignal, and eminent command: So <hi>St John</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his commandment, that we believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent:</hi> What is it <hi>to believe on the name of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but to receive and embrace Chriſt offering himſelf in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to us, and to live upon him, having ſo received and embraced him? Now (ſayes he) <hi>this is his commandment,</hi> his great, his ſpecial commandment, his commandment in a moſt ſignal, &amp; eminent manner; and Chriſt himſelf aſſerts the ſame thing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.28, 29. In the 28 <hi>v.</hi> They ask him, <hi>what ſhall we do, that we may works the Work of God?</hi> His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the 29. <hi>v.</hi> is, <hi>This is the Work of God, that ye believe on him, whom he hath ſent:</hi> i. e. That ye receive and embrace me, and live upon me, by believing: This is [the] Work of God, the great work which he commands you, and expects from you: Believing (as <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves upon this place) is not called <hi>the Work of God;</hi>

                  </note> becauſe 'tis of Gods operation (as you have it elſe where) or that which God works in us; but becauſe 'tis the great thing which he commands, and requires of us. To reject, and refuſe Chriſt then, is a ſin againſt a ſignal and emenient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; indeed againſt the great command of the Goſpel; and therefore muſt needs be a great, and crying ſin: more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:94533:87"/>1. The neglect and refuſal of Chriſt, and his love, is a ſin againſt a clear and expreſs command of God, a command wherein the authority of God does peculiarly and eminently ſhine forth: So much is held forth in the place mentioned before 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.28. <hi>this is his commandment</hi> (ſays he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the commandment of Faith) his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Commandment, a Commandment wherein his authority is evidently and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly ſeen; the authority of God ſhines forth in all his commands, but eſpecially in this above the reſt: Therefore this you ſee has an emphaſie put upon it: <hi>This is his commandment:</hi> Now the more clearly and eminently the authority of God ſhines forth in any command, the greater our ſin and guilt is in tranſgreſſing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The neglect and refuſal of Chriſt and his love, is a ſin againſt a command, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the heart of God and Chriſt does much lye; and is therefore a great ſin: This is a true Rule: That the more the mind or heart of the Law-Giver is in any law or command, the greater is our ſin and guilt in the breach and tranſgreſſion of that law or command: Now God's command to us to receive Chriſt by believing, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand wherein his own heart, as well as the heart of Chriſt, does much lye: indeed there is nothing in all the World, that the heart of God and Chriſt is more ſet upon, or deſirous of, then this; that Souls ſhould
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94533:88"/>embrace Chriſt by believing, and become one with him in a Marriage-Covenant: Witneſs the freeneſs of their offers, the frequency of their calls, the importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their pleas, the patientneſs of their waitings, the affectionateneſs of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, the friendlineſs of their upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the patheticalneſs of their lamentings, the ſweetneſs of their wooings, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedneſs of their drawings, and the graciouſneſs of their dealings in reference hereunto: But you have already ſeen, how much the heart of Chriſt, and in him the heart of the Father is in this buſineſs: now to tranſgreſs ſuch a command, a command wherein the heart of God and Chriſt does ſo much lye, and to run coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to that, which they ſo much deſire, O what a ſin muſt this needs be?</p>
               <p>The neglect and refuſal of Chriſt, is a ſin againſt a command which has vertually all the commands of God in it, and ſo in the breach and tranſgreſſion thereof we break and tranſgreſs all; and O how great a ſin then muſt this be? to believe on Chriſt is comprehenſive of all that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and requires of us; this is ſo his Commandment, as that in obeying this we obey all; And in violating this we violate all; and ſo he eſteems and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it: This is evident from <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.28, 29. <hi>What ſhall we do (ſay they) that we may work the works of God? This is the work of God</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>to believe on
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94533:88"/>him whom he hath ſent:</hi> Pray, mark, they ſpeak of [works] in the plural Number: They would know what all thoſe works were which God requir'd,<note place="margin">Loquuti erant de operibus, Chriſtus ad unum opus eos revocat, hoc eſt, ad ſidem, quo ſignificat quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid extra fidem homines moliun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur inutile ac vanum eſſe, ſolam vero fidem ſufficere. <hi>Calv. in Loc.</hi>
                  </note> and what the extent of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was: And Chriſt in his Anſwer reduces all to one, and that is Faith; by which he ſhews that as all is vain without Faith, ſo Faith is vertually all that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: <hi>This is the Work of God:</hi> (ſays he) as if he ſhould ſay, here's all in one, to believe on, and receive me is comprehenſive of all; and accordingly, my beloved, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Chriſt and his love is to break all at once, and to violate all at once? 'Tis to rebel againſt and poure contempt upon the whole mind and will of God at once,<note place="margin">Appellat Chriſtus infidelitatem ſimpliciter peccatum, quia pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum infidelitatis omne peccatum complectitur. <hi>Cher.</hi>
                  </note> and in effect to renounce all duty and allegiance to him: Suitable where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is the obſervations of a learned Man upon that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8, 9. <hi>Chriſt here</hi> (ſays he) <hi>calls unbelief [Sin] Simply and abſolutly becauſe that ſin comprehends all ſin in it:</hi> O how great a ſin then muſt this be?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The neglect and refuſal of Chriſt, is a ſin againſt a command of much love: All Gods commands have love in them: They are deſign'd by him for our good (as the Scripture tells us) but eſpecially
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94533:89"/>this command of his, that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and embrace his Son: For what is this command, but a command to us, to be ſaved, a command to us, to be happy? What is this, but a commanding of us, to Live for ever more, to be eternally bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in and with himſelf? And O how great a ſin muſt the tranſgreſſion of ſuch a command be? Did God command us any hard or ſevere thing, ſomething that tended to our prejudice, and not our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that were ſomewhat; but when he commands us nothing but to be happy, and to be happy in the beſt way: O how great a ſin muſt it be to tranſgreſs ſuch a command?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, the neglect and refuſal of Chriſt is a ſin, which in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner derogates from him, and poures great contempt upon him, and therefore a great ſin: The more contempt any ſin poures upon Chriſt, and the more it derogates from him, the greater that ſin is: Now what ſin derogates more from Chriſt, or poures greater contempt upon him, then the neglect and refuſal of him, offering himſelf to us, does? This is a ſin which takes the Crown off from Chriſt's head, and throwes it in the Duſt: It every way, and in all reſects poures great contempt upon him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this ſin vilifies and poures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Perſon of Chriſt: Chriſt's Perſon is infinitely excellent, and infinitely
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94533:89"/>amiable, and accordingly to vilifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn his Perſon muſt be a great ſin, and contract great guilt, and this the refuſal of him, does: Hence, call'd <hi>a treading under foot of the Son of God</hi> (which Argues the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt contempt imaginable) <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. Every refuſal of Chriſt carries that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage concerning him in it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2. <hi>When we ſee him, there is no Beauty in him, for which we ſhould deſire him: He has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form, nor comlineſs in him:</hi> He is a perſon of no worth, no deſireableneſs: O what contempt is this to be caſt upon Chriſt, and how much does it derogate from him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſin vilifies, and poures contempt upon the work, office, and undertaking of Chriſt, as Mediator; upon all that he has done, and ſuffer'd, withall the riches of his Grace, and Love, manifeſted therein: Hence 'tis call'd, as <hi>a treading of the Son of God under foot, ſo an accounting his Blood a common and an unholy thing,</hi> a thing of no worth, no uſe, no value, no excellency, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.

                  </note> was the work, and undertaking of Chriſt, as our Mediator, and great were the things, which he both did and ſuffer'd in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that work and undertaking; great alſo was his Grace, and Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in all, and accordingly, great muſt our ſin and guilt be, in pouring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt thereon, which we do by our refuſing of him: Hereby we pour contempt upon
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94533:90"/>all his acts and all his offices, as Mediator, upon all his Merits, and all his Purchaſes, upon all his Grace and Love in bleeding and Dying for us: We do hereby in effect ſay, that neither Chriſt, nor any thing which he has purchas'd, is worth accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and embracing: That we had rather, that he had never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

O what horred contempt of Chriſt is this?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſin plainly preferrs a poor, Baſe, Vile luſt before Chriſt, and all the Glorious Riches and Treaſures of Chriſt: and O what contempt of him is this? Why do men refuſe Chriſt, and the offers of his Love? Surely 'tis for the ſake, and from the Love of ſome luſt or other, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>the luſt of the Fleſh, the luſt of the Eye, or the pride of Life;</hi> and if ſo, then by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of him they do really prefer this Luſt before him, and all the Treaſures of his Grace and Love: And thus indeed you find it to be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. <hi>Reginning</hi> as alſo <hi>Luke.</hi> 14.18, 19, 20. Where Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf, withall his Treaſures, to poor Sinners, who yet ſlight and refuſe both
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94533:90"/>him and them: And why ſo? <hi>The one hath a farm, the other a Merchandize,</hi> and all have ſome carnal concern, to mind: the Sum is, they have a luſt to be ſatisfied; and therefore Chriſt, and all the Treaſures of his Love, muſt be rejected; By refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Chriſt we do in effect ſay, that there is more good, more ſweetneſs, more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in a luſt, in a little carnall, worldly pleaſure and advantage, then there is in Chriſt, and all that is his: Hereby we do in effect ſay, that men are deceiv'd in Chriſt, that the Word of God makes a falſe report of him, that he is not ſuch a Saviour, nor is his Salvation ſo great as the one, and the other is repreſented to be: O what contempt is this to be caſt upon Chriſt? <hi>Eſau</hi> (yow know) is ſaid <hi>to deſpiſe his Birth right;</hi> and how? <hi>By preferring a meſs of pottage or a morſel of Meat before it,</hi> Gen. 25.34. But O how much more do we contemn Chriſt and his Love by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a baſe, vile luſt before him and it? Surely greater contempt of Chriſt than this can't well be found: And how great then muſt the ſin of the refuſal of Chriſt be, and how much ſhould we tremble at it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that the neglect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of Chriſt is a ſin which in an eminent manner darkens and oppoſes the Glory of God, and reflects the higheſt Diſhonour upon him of all others; and therefore a great ſin: The more any ſin darkens and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94533:91"/>oppoſes the Glory of God, the greater the guilt of that ſin is: For (firſt) the more any ſin oppoſes the Glory of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects Diſhonour upon him, the more contrary it is to the higheſt good; and the more contrary any ſin is to the higheſt good, the greater the guilt of it muſt needs be: And Secondly, the more any ſin op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Glory of God, and reflects Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour upon him, the more it thwarts and contradicts the higheſt end of Man; and the more any ſin thwarts and contradicts the higheſt end of Man, the greater the guilt of that ſin is:</p>
               <p>Now the neglect and refuſal of Chriſt is what eminently oppoſes the Glory of God, and reflects Diſhonour upon him: The reception and entertainment of Chriſt puts an honour upon the Father: Indeed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of Faith honours God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. And eſpecially this great and Fundamental act of Faith, in embracing Chriſt: So on the other hand, the neglect and refuſal of Chriſt is what reflects Diſhonour upon God, it throws his Glory in the duſt; and hence 'tis, that this ſin is ſo exceeding provoking to him, as in the Scripture it is repreſented to be: Particularly take here two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This ſin of refuſing Chriſt is what ſlights and contemns all the Glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and perfections of God at once; and ſo can't but caſt very great Diſhonour upon him, and be very oppoſite to his Glory: In Chriſt, my Beloved, all the

In him does his wiſdom, yea, his manifold wiſdom, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and reveal its ſelf: In a word, whole God is manifeſted and revealed in him, and withall tender'd to the embraces of our Faith and Love: In every offer of Chriſt made to us in the Goſpel, God does in effect ſay to us, what ever I am, or can do, as God, that Il'e be to, and do for you, to make you happy for ever: accordingly to refuſe Chriſt muſt needs poure contempt upon all: It ſlights and poures contempt upon the Grace of God, the wiſdom of God, the power of God, the juſtice of God, the Holineſs of God, the Fulneſs and All-ſufficiency of God, and all the Ancient Glorious counſels of his Love concerning Souls: to refuſe Chriſt is in effect to ſay, that the Grace of God is no Grace, at leaſt not worthy of our acceptance: That his juſtice and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs are not to be regarded, and that we value them not: That his wiſdom is folly,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94533:92"/>and his power weakneſs; that his fulneſs has little in it, and is no way able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us, and make us happy: that a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ciſtern is as good, as that Fountain of living waters: And hereby we down-right deny his Faithfulneſs, and put the lie upon him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. We do in effect ſay, that the God of truth is a liar, that his witneſs and teſtimony is not to be credited, that his word of promiſe is a meer deluſion, and for no other uſe, then to beguile Souls: O what contempt, what Diſhonour muſt all this caſt upon the bleſſed God, and what horrible wickedneſs muſt it be? <hi>to make God a liar</hi> (ſayes a Learned Man) <hi>is an horrible and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable impiety:</hi>

               <p n="2">2. This ſin of refuſing Chriſt is what is directly oppoſite to the higheſt deſign of God for his own Glory, and Robs him of that Glory which is moſt dear to him: what, my Beloved, was the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that ever God laid and carried on for his own Glory? Verily 'twas Chriſt, and the Salvation of ſinners by Chriſt: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd himſelf a revenue of Glory in making the World, and he does deſign himſelf a revenue of Glory in all he does in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World: But that wherein he has deſign'd the higheſt revenue of Glory to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94533:92"/>himſelf, is the miſtery of Chriſt, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt: So much is evident from <hi>Epe.</hi> 1.11, 12, 14. <hi>In whom</hi> ſayes he ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>We have obtained an inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him, who worketh all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſel of his own will, that we ſhould be to the praiſe of his Glory;</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>unto the praiſe of his Glory:</hi> The ſum is this, that God's Glory was his great end in the diſpenſation of Chriſt, and our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him; and alſo that in and by that diſpenſation he did deſign the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of Glory to himſelf: For pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, firſt he calls it <hi>the praiſe of his Glory,</hi> the ſplendor, and higheſt emanation of his Glory: (Secondly) he repeats this deſign of God <hi>to the praiſe of his Glory,</hi> and again, <hi>to the praiſe of his Glory;</hi> which notes this to be his grand deſign for his Glory. Again, what is that Glory that is moſt dear to God? Verily 'tis the Glory of his Grace: Grace is his darling attribute, and the Glory of his Grace is moſt dear to him: Hence this has been peculiarly his deſign in the whole of the miſtery of Chriſt: So the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. Who having before ſpoken of the great miſteries of predeſtination and redemption by Chriſt; here in the 6. <hi>v.</hi> tells you, what was God's great deſign in all, viz: <hi>The praiſe of the Glory of his Grace:</hi> 'Tis the crowning of Grace, and the enthroning of Grace, which God in a peculiar manner delights
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94533:93"/>in: Now if the higheſt deſign of God for his own Glory be by the miſtery of Chriſt, and our Salvation by Chriſt, and the Glory of his Grace be moſt dear to him; then 'tis clear, that our refuſing of Chriſt is moſt oppoſite to the higheſt deſign that God ever carried on for his own Glory, and Robs him of that Glory which is moſt dear to him: For alas! This is in effect to ſay, that God has laid out no Grace upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the diſpenſation of Chriſt, and that he deſerves no Glory upon the account of that diſpenſation: This is in effect to tell him, that neither his Chriſt, nor his Grace in him, is worth minding, worth recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and that we are no wayes beholding to him for the one, or the other: And O what Diſhonour muſt this reflect upon God, and how darkening to his Glory? And accordingly, Soul, let thee and I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at it, and at the Blackneſs and horrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that ſin, that has ſuch a dreadful effect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider, that the neglect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of Chriſt, is a ſin which directly and immediatly murders the ſoul, and damns it eternally; and therefore muſt needs be a great ſin: That ſin that does moſt direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediatly murder the Soul, and deſtroy it eternally, that muſt needs be a great ſin, and ſhould be greatly dreaded by us: And what ſin is it that does this, but our neglect and refuſal of Chriſt? And, Soul, that thou may'ſt be the more deeply
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94533:93"/>convinced of this, ſeriouſly weigh theſe following propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the neglect and refuſal of Chriſt is a ſin, which rejects the onely remedy of ſinful ſouls: Poor Sinners are in themſelves dead, loſt, undone, and periſhing for ever: They are ſick, and ſick to death; they are ſinful, and ſinful to damnation; and there is one, and but one remedy for them, and that's Chriſt; Chriſt and his Blood, Chriſt and his Grace, Chriſt and his fulneſs; Beſides this, <hi>there is no Balm in Gilead, no Phyſitian there for them; neither is there Salvation in any other,</hi> Acts. 4.14. Therefore by refuſing and rejecting him, they refuſe and reject the onely remedy: He indeed is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, as well as an onely, remedy: He is able, and as willing, as <hi>he is able, to ſave to the very uttermoſt,</hi> as the Scripture tells us: But they by rejecting of him exclude themſelves from his ſaving efficacy, and ſo thereby do directly murder their own ſouls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the neglect and refuſal of Chriſt is a ſin, which bindes all a mans other ſins faſt to him: 'Tis a great and weighty ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which a worthy Divine has. Unbelief, ſayes he (which is properly the neglect and refuſal of Chriſt) bindes all a mans ſins faſt to his Soul, and Damnation faſt to his ſins: 'Tis indeed the Bond of all our guilt, and all our miſery; that which makes the curſe cleave cloſe to us for ever: And while a man remains in this ſin, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94533:94"/>that he ſhould be acquitted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the guilt of any one of all his ſins: 'Tis (I remember) <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8, 9.<note place="margin">Ponit hoc peccatum infidelitatis ſpecialiter, quia hos manente caetera manent, hoc decedente caetera remittuntur, <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> Where Chriſt tells us, <hi>That his Spirit ſhall convince the World of Sin, becauſe they believe not in him: Chriſt</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in the ſin of infidelity in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becauſe that ſin remaining, all our other ſins remain: But that being taken away, all others are forgiven:</hi> Faith (as one of the Ancients expreſſes it) <hi>delet omnia pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata,</hi> blots out all ſins; but unbelief that bindes all faſt upon us: Hence that word of Chriſt, <hi>If ye betieve not, ye ſhall dye in your ſins:</hi> i. e. your ſins ſhall cleave cloſe to you to the very death, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8.24. This will be further evident in the next propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: Therefore</p>
               <p n="3">3. That though all ſin be killing and damning, yet no ſin ſhall ever damn or deſtroy us, unleſs we add thereunto the ſin of the neglect and refuſal of Chriſt: 'Tis true, every ſin is damning; ſin within, ſin without: <hi>The wages of ſin is death, Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>last.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, <hi>there is a just recompence of reward due to every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and diſobedience, Heb.</hi> 1.2. But though every ſin be damning, yet what ever a mans ſins are, though never ſo many, never ſo great; they ſhall, they can never damn him, in caſe he receives, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94533:94"/>Chriſt: Nor indeed can any of all a mans ſins be ſaid to be the immediate cauſe of his damnation, but his refuſing of Chriſt: Indeed under the Law the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe of mens periſhing was ſin in general: But under the Goſpel the onely immediate cauſe of mens periſhing is the rejection of Chriſt and his Grace through unbelief: So much Chriſt himſelf tells us in that known place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth on the Son is not condemned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Meritum damnationis juxta Evangelium, non eſt peccatum, ſed preſeverantia finalis in pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato infidelitatis, <hi>Twiſ. vind. gra.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>but he that believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed on the name of the onely begotten Son of God: He that believeth on Christ is not condemned:</hi> And why ſo? Is it becauſe he has no ſins to condemn him? No, but becauſe believing on Chriſt all his ſins are done away: But <hi>he that believeth not on him is condemn'd already:</hi> And why? Is it becauſe he is a ſinner in general, or becauſe his ſins are many and great ſins? No, but <hi>becauſe he hath not believed on the name of the onely begotten Son of God:</hi> The ſum of all is this: The immediate cauſe of mens condemnation is not this ſin or that ſin, but their refuſing of Chriſt by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: Hence you have it ſo frequently up and down the Goſpel: <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved: He that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> and the like; Well then, if our vefuſing of Chriſt be the rejecting of the onely remedy of ſinful Souls; if it be what
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94533:95"/>bindes all a mans ſins faſt upon him; and if none of all a mans other ſins, though many and great, ſhould or could ever damn him, were not this ſin of refuſing Chriſt added to them; then certainly this is that ſin which does moſt directly and immediatly murder the Soul: O how great a ſin then does this ſpeak it to be? Murder is a great ſin; an iniquity to be puniſhed by the judge; nor do we look upon a murderee fit to live: But no murder like to Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murder, nor ſhould we ſuffer this Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murderer to live one moment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider, that the neglect and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of Chriſt is a ſin which argues you to be really in Love with your ſins, which truly and indeed chooſes Death rather then Life, loves Darkneſs more then Light, and which leaves you without the leaſt colour of excuſe or room of appeal for ever: And O what a black and horrid ſin muſt this then be? A little of each.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This ſin of neglecting and refuſing Chriſt, is, what really argues you to be in Love with your ſins, and to have ſlight thoughts of them: For men to act ſin is bad; but to have ſlight thoughts of ſin, and to be in Love with it, is much worſe; ſin being againſt an infinite good, even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly contrary to the bleſſed God, has in a ſort an infinite evil in it; and to be in love with that which has an infinite evil in it, O how dreadful a thing is this? Yet this your refuſal of Chriſt carries in it: For
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94533:95"/>pray, mark, had you not ſlight thoughts of ſin, you would not refuſe the pardon of ſin, when offer'd you; but would account it worthy of all acceptation; and were you not in Love with your ſins, yea, greatly in Love with them, you would not chooſe and deſire to continue in your ſins; much leſs would you refuſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo great a good, as Chriſt is, for the ſake of your ſins: Should a condemn'd Malefactor refuſe the Kings free pardon, would not this argue him to have ſlight thoughts of Death; yea, to be in Love with it, and to prefer it before life? As clearly does your refuſing of Chriſt argue you to have ſlight thoughts of ſin, and to be in Love with it: O were you not in Love with your ſins, you would be glad of a diſcharge and deliverance from them, and would withall readineſs and joyfulneſs embrace it, when freely offer'd to you, as in Chriſt it is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſin of refuſing Chriſt is what truly and indeed ſpeaks you to love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs more then light, and to choſe death rather then life: 'Tis what prefers ſin and death before Chriſt, and life, and Grace; O what a black ſin then muſt it be? This Chriſt himſelf aſſerts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and that as an high aggravation of it, and what makes it doubly damning, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the World, and men love darkneſs rather then light.</hi> Chriſt and the good
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94533:96"/>things of Chriſt are here call'd light; on the other hand ſin and death, ſin and the miſeries that attend it, are call'd dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Now (ſayes Chriſt) men by unbelief and refuſing of me do declare, that they love this darkneſs before this Light: Men by refuſing of me do in effect love, chooſe, prefer ſin, and death, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before me, and my Grace, me and that eternal life which I would give them: O what a ſin is this? Chriſt may truly ſay to Sinners, as <hi>Moſes</hi> to them of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19. <hi>I call Heaven, and Earth to record this day, that I have ſet before you, Life and Death, bleſſing and curſing; therefore chooſe life, that ye may live:</hi> Now, for them to chooſe death and reject life, to chooſe the curſe and reject the bleſſing: This is a dreadful ſin indeed and the more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: On the one hand, becauſe the light is ſo lovely and amiable; and on the other hand, the darkneſs is ſo odious &amp; terrible: as alſo becauſe the obligations which lie upon us to love, chooſe, and prefer the light before darkneſs, are ſo weighty and forcible: For Chriſt earneſtly deſires it, he graciouſly counſells it, he ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it, and no leſs then a whole eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Glorious and unſpeakable happineſs depends upon it: O think of theſe things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſin of refuſing Chriſt is a ſin which leaves you without the leaſt colour of excuſe, or room of appeal for ever;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94533:96"/>which muſt argue it to be a great ſin indeed: Firſt, it leaves you without the leaſt colour of excuſe, without the leaſt coulour of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for ſin, and without the leaſt colour of excuſe why you ſhould not die for ſin: This Chriſt himſelf is expreſs in, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22. <hi>If I had not come, and ſpoken to them, they had not had ſin, but now they have no Cloak for their ſin: If I had not come, and ſpoken to them</hi> (viz. in the Goſpel) revealing my Father's will; and offering my ſelf and my Grace to them; <hi>They had not had ſin.</hi> i. e. Not ſo great ſin: <hi>But now they have no Cloak,</hi> no excuſe <hi>for their ſin:</hi> Now they have no pretence to make, nothing wherewith to colour or extenuate their ſin: The neglect and refuſal of Chriſt leaves men altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, and it will do ſo to be ſure in the laſt day: O when God in the day of his righteous judgment ſhall demand of men that have liv'd under the Goſpel; why they ſin'd, and having ſin'd, why they are found in their ſins, and being found in their ſins, why they ſhould not die for ever: what will they have to ſay by way of excuſe or apology for themſelves? Verily nothing; but will be <hi>Speechleſs,</hi> as he is ſaid to be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12. They can't ſay, they were not warned of the evil of ſin: They can't ſay, that pardon and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation were not offer'd them: They can't ſay, that the offer was not full, and free, and clear: They can't ſay, they had to do with an hard Maſter; nor can they ſay,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94533:97"/>that ſin is not worthy of death: They will have nothing to ſay. Secondly, it leaves you without the leaſt room or place of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal for ever: I may ſay here, as 'tis ſaid in anorher caſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. <hi>If one man ſin againſt another, the judge ſhall judge him; but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for him?</hi> So if a man ſin againſt the Law by tranſgreſſing of it, he may appeal to the Goſpel, and the grace of Chriſt there: But if a man ſin againſt Chriſt and his Grace offer'd in the Goſpel, where then ſhall he appeal? Verily there is no appeal to be made, no relief to be found for him. If a man be condemn'd at the ſeat of juſtice, as having ſinn'd againſt the Law, he may appeal unto the mercy-ſeat, the throne of Grace, and ſind ſweet relief; but if he ſin againſt the mercy-ſeat, and the throne of Grace, then he has nothing to appaal to, that may adminiſter relief to him: Now by refuſing of Chriſt we ſin againſt the Throne of Grace, we pull down, what in us lies, the mercy-ſeat: and where then ſhall we appeal? O conſider theſe things, and learn by them to dread this ſin of refuſing Chriſt: I might ſay much more to convince you of the hainous evil of it; but let this ſuffice: Sure I am, 'tis enough to; and had we the due ſenſe of it upon our Spirits, it would, make us tremble at it for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wouldeſt thou indeed be Eſpouſed to Chriſt? Then give not way to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of ſenſe; but bear up thy Soul
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94533:97"/>upon the encouragements of Faith, upon ſuch Goſpel-principles &amp; conſiderations, as do tend to draw ſinners to Faith in Chriſt: Poſſibly, upon reading and conſidering the woeful miſery of thy condition without Chriſt, and the dreadful hainouſneſs of thy ſin and guilt, in thy long and frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing of him, diſcouragements not a few may ariſe within; and indeed no ſooner uſually does a poor Soul look towards Chriſt, or think of cloſing with him in a Marriage-Covenant; but preſently mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of diſcouragements ariſe to deter him there from: O, ſays he, what a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſinner am I? How have I deſpiſed Chriſt and his grace? How long have I ſtood it out againſt him? I have ſerv'd my luſts all my dayes, and rejected his calls: To what purpoſe do I now talk of cloſing with him? Theſe, and multitudes ſuch like diſcouragements do ariſe in the Soul, which being given way to, do effectually keep him from Chriſt: But if ever, Soul, thou wouldeſt attain to Union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, thou muſt ſhut thine eyes and heart too againſt all diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this nature; and though they preſs in upon thee again and again; yet thruſt them out fixing thine eye and heart upon the encouragements of Faith; dwell much in the thoughts of them, and bear up thy ſoul upon ſuch Goſpel principles and conſiderations, as do tend to weaken unbelief, &amp; beget Faith in the ſoul; and for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94533:98"/>thy help herein I ſhal mention ſome of theſe encouragements of Faith, or Goſpel-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which I would have thee to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and frequent in the contemplation of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Goſpel-principle, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Faith, which thou ſhouldſt bear up thy Soul upon, and be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the contemplation of, is this; that there is a rich, a glorious, and an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing fulneſs of all good treaſured up in Chriſt for poor Sinners; and that his Grace does abundantly exceed both our wants and ſins: 'Tis the work and nature of unbelief, to little and limit the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt in the eye of the ſoul: It ſhews the ſoul the multitude of his ſins and wants; but it conceals and Locks up Chriſts treaſures and fulneſs: And, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we pretend, the ground of our not cloſing with Chriſt, at leaſt one principal one, is this, that we doubt of his fulneſs, we do not ſee enough in Chriſt to ſupply our wants, and relieve our diſtreſſes: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief perſwading us, that Chriſt is not the Chriſt, the Scripture repreſents him to be: But, Soul, away with all ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and dwell thou in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Chriſt's infinite fulneſs: Look to him, as one infinitly able to ſupply thy wants, to pardon thy ſins, to healthy maladies, to ſubdue thy luſts, to ſanctifie thy heart, and to ſave thy Soul eternally: Look upon him, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repreſents him: The Scripture tells
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:94533:98"/>thee, <hi>That it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. All fulneſs of Grace and life, all fulneſs of peace and pardon, all fulneſs of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Salvation: There is in Chriſt not onely a fulneſs of abundance, but of redundance, an over-flowing ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; a fulneſs infinitly ſuperabounding our ſins and wants: The Scripture tells us, <hi>That he is able to ſave unto the very uttermoſt, all that come unto God by him,</hi> Heb. 7.25. Save, able to ſave, able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt; and that not one or two, but all that come unto God by him: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of Chriſts <hi>unſearchable riches,</hi> Eph. 3.8. The Ocean of his Grace is not to be ſounded by the longeſt line of the largeſt created underſtanding: <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the ſuperabounding fulneſs of his Grace, and has left it upon record for our encouragement, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant;</hi> it was more then enough: I found more Grace in Chriſt (as one expreſſes it) then I knew what to do withall; and yet what was this <hi>Paul?</hi> Himſelf tells you in the very <hi>v.</hi> before and after, he was <hi>a Blaſphemer, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, and the chief of Sinners,</hi> a man every way of as many ſins and wants, as thou art: Accordingly view him, and bear up thy Soul in the face of all diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Reaſon thus with thy ſelf: True, my condition is ſad, my wants are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, and my ſins exceeding great: But
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94533:99"/>what then? <hi>Is there no Balm in Gilead? Is there no Phyſitian there?</hi> Is not Chriſt able to ſave me, and that to the utmoſt notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all: Look, O my ſoul, yonder is ſweet Jeſus upon the Throne at the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Right Hand, full of Grace and truth; look upon him, and conſider: What are all thy wants to his Riches and fulneſs? What are all thy miſeries and diſtreſſes to his Bowels of Mercy? What are all thy ſins to the merit of his Blood, thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to his fatisfaction? Were thy wants more and greater then they are, his fulneſs could ſupply them all; were thy ſins greater and more hainous then they are, his Blood could cleanſe thee from all: <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin,</hi> 1 Jo. 1.7. There is infinitly more worth in his merits to pardon and juſtifie thee, then there is evil in thy ſins to damn &amp; deſtroy thee: True, I have a Fountain of ſin, and guilt, and death in me: But here's a deeper Fountain of Grace, and life, &amp; righteouſneſs in him: ſee, O my Soul, ſee how vaſt and large his treaſures of Grace and Glory are, and bear up thy ſelf upon them: O did Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners dwell more in the view of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fulneſs of Chriſt, they would be more in love with him; and hereby would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-work and undermine unbelief in one of its greateſt artifices, whereby it keeps ſouls from him. I ſhall here for thy encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement onely ſubjoyn the ſaying of a worthy Divine. Chriſt (ſayes he) can, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94533:99"/>it becometh him well to give more then my narrow ſoul can receive. If there were ten thouſand thouſand millions of worlds, and as many heavens full of men and Angels, Chriſt would not be pinched to ſupply all their wants, and to fill them all. Chriſt is a Well of Life, but who knoweth how deep it is to the bottom?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Goſpel-principle or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Faith which thou ſhould'ſt bear up thy ſoul upon, and be frequent in the contemplation of, is this: That as there is ſuch a Glorious and in-exhauſtible fulneſs in Chriſt, ſo this fulneſs is in him, not for himſelf, but to be diſpenſed and communicated to poor Souls coming to him: True (may the Soul ſay) here's fulneſs enough, riches and treaſures e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of all good in Chriſt; but what's this to me, or wherein does it concern me? Wherein does it concern thee? Why, 'tis wholly thy concern, and the concern of ſuch, as thou art: For what ever fulneſs he has in him, 'tis treaſur'd up in him for Souls, for Sinners, yea, for the worſt of Sinners: How ſweet is that word? <hi>Pſa.</hi> 68.18. where, ſpeaking of Chriſt, the holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>that he hath received gifts for men: He hath received gifts.</hi> i. e. He has a fulneſs of all good in his hand, and at his diſpoſe, and this for men: I but I am a devil (ſayes the ſoul) a rebel, &amp; what's this to me? obſerve, what follows, and thou wilt find it concerns thee, yea,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94533:100"/>thee eſpecially: <hi>He hath received gifts for men, yea, for the rebellious alſo:</hi> Hence alſo 'tis, that he is ſaid to be made <hi>Head over all things to the Church, Eph.</hi> 1.22. <hi>He has all fulneſs dwelling in him,</hi> but 'tis as an head, and ſo 'tis all for the uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the body, for every poor ſoul that comes to him: And therefore 'tis added, <hi>Head over all things to the Church.</hi> i<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>e. For the Churches uſe and ſervice of which he is Head: Take a view of all that fulneſs that is in Chriſt, and 'tis all as much and as really for the uſe and ſervice of ſuch as come to him, and are made members of his body, as the treaſures and endowments of the natural head are for the uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the natural body, and the members thereof: And O what an encouragement is this to Faith? 'Tis the obſervation of a learned man upon the place laſt quoted. <hi>Leſt</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>we ſhould think this great glory of Chriſt to be a thing that does not concern us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ne ſummam illam Chriſti glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam putemus aliquid a nobis alienum, eſſe, teſtatur illum eſſe a Deo patre totius Eccleſiae, <hi>Beza.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>he is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to be conſtituted and appointed by the Father to be Head of the whole Church.</hi> Well then, ſoul, bear up thy ſelf upon this encouragement: Say, look, O my ſoul, look unto ſweet Jeſus, who hath received Gifts for men: View him as one that has received a fulneſs of all Grace from the Father on purpoſe to be diſpens'd and communicated to thee, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94533:100"/>to ſuch as thou art: He has life in him, and he has it for thee; he has peace and pardon in him, and he has it for thee: He has wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, Grace, and Glory in him, and he has it for thee, and for ſuch as thou art; and therefore go to him, expect all from him, caſt all upon him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Goſpel-principle or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Faith, which thou ſhouldſt bear up thy ſoul upon, and dwell much in the contemplation of, is this, that there is a perfect freedom and willingneſs in Chriſt, yea, 'tis even genuine and naturall to him to beſtow himſelf, with all his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious riches and fulneſs, upon poor ſouls coming to him: Chriſt (as you heard) has all this fulneſs in him as an head; ſo you have it expreſly, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18, 19. Now as 'tis genuine and naturall to the head to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter influence to the members: So 'tis even genuine and naturall to Chriſt to communicate his Grace to poor ſouls: Beſides, all that fulneſs that is in Chriſt, 'tis in him not as God onely, but as man: 'Tis depoſited and treaſured up in his human nature: <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell, Col.</hi> 1.19. <hi>In him</hi> i. e. (as a learned man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it (<hi>in the man Chriſt, or in that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature in which he dyed and tranſacted the buſineſs of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In co, <hi>i. e.</hi> In homine Chriſto, vel in humana illa natura in qua obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit &amp; adminiſtravit negotium ſalutis noſtrae, <hi>Daven.</hi>
                  </note> 'Tis true, the God-head or Divine nature is the firſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94533:101"/>ſpring or Fountain of all Graee; but the human nature of Chriſt is as it were a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſpring and Fountain of Grace: That is as a treaſury or Store-houſe, wherein all Grace is laid up for us: Hence 'tis ſaid, <hi>that as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo he hath given to the Son to have life in himſelf; becauſe he is the Son of man,</hi> Joh, 5.26, 27. Chriſt as God hath life, i.e. all Grace ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally and independently in him, as the Father hath: Indeed as God he is the ſame infinite and independent Fountain of Life and Grace with the Father: but 'tis as man that he is ſaid to have Life and Grace given to him: The ſum then is, That that Glorious fulneſs of Grace that is in Chriſt for Sinners, is Fountain'd up in his human nature, and being Fountain'd up in his human nature it will, and can't but ſlow, yea, overflow to, and upon poor ſouls, that caſt themſelves upon him: The truth is, 'Tis to charge Chriſt with unkindneſs and unſaithfulneſs both at once, to ſuppoſe him unwilling to communicate himſelf and his fulneſs to Sinners coming to him; and, ſoul, canſt thou find in thy heart to lay ſo blacka charge upon ſo ſweet and good a Chriſt? 'Tis the way and work of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and unbelief to perſwade Souls, that Chriſt will not receive them, nor commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his Grace and fulneſs to them; though they ſhould come to him, which they endeavour to do from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his greatneſs and holineſs, together
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94533:101"/>with their vileneſs and ſinfulneſs: Chriſt, ſay they, is choice and peculiar in his Love and reſpects, as great Perſons uſe to be: He will know his diſtance, and he will make Sinners know theirs: But, Soul, deal with this, as from the devil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, reject it as a reproach thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, and dwell much in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of his infinite willingneſs to receive and ſave the worſt of Sinners that come to him: Reaſon it a little with thy ſelf: Why did he become incarnate? Why did he bleed, and die? Why does he woo, and wait, and offer, and call, and ſtrive with poor Sinners to win them to himſelf? Does it not all argue a willingneſs and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in him to give forth both himſelf and his fulneſs to them?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fourth Goſpel-principle or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Faith, which thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bear up thy ſoul upon, and dwell much in the contemplation of, is this: That the onely ſpring and principle of all that ever Chriſt does for poor Sinners from firſt to laſt is his own Soverain Grace and Love: 'Twas his Love that brought him down from Heaven, and that led him out to Bleed and die for them: Hence <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. he is ſaid <hi>to Love his Church, and give himſelf for it:</hi> 'Tis his Love, his free Love, that firſt draws them to himſelf, and allures them into Covenant with him: <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love; therefore with loving kindneſs have I drawn
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94533:102"/>thee,</hi> Jer. 31.3. 'Tis his Love that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them, that pardons them, that beſtows life and Salvation upon them: Hence all is ſaid to be <hi>of Grace,</hi> even the whole of our Salvation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. Hence he is repreſented to us as ſitting upon a Throne of Grace, and there 'tis that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to come to him, and from thence give out all to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. and therefore to that Throne we, though Sinners, may come boldly: He is upon a Throne; and therefore we may aſſure our ſelves, that he will do great things for Sinners coming to him; he will act like a King, pardon like a King, ſave like a King, do all with Kingly greatneſs and magnificence: And 'tis a Throne of Grace, a Throne that reigns Grace, a Throne whereon Grace ſits in imperial Majeſty, and decrees all for poor Sinners coming to it; and ſo does all freely, all in a way of Soverain Grace and Love: Hence that Language, <hi>I will have mercy, becauſe I will have mercy,</hi> I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, becauſe I will pardon, and I will ſave, becauſe I will ſave: Now what an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is this to Faith, and how, if rightly weighed and conſider'd, would it daſh all the pleas of unbelief to pieces, and ſweetly draw the Soul on to a cloſe with Chriſt in a Marriage-Covenant? For pray conſider, what is the nature of Soverain Grace and Love? The nature of it is to act from it ſelf to itſelf without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of any thing in us, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94533:102"/>either the worthineſs or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of the creature at all: The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it is ſuch, that 'tis neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to, nor reſtrain'd from doing good to ſouls by any thing either of good or evil in them; but all runs freely: And therefore no matter what I am, though never ſo vile and wretched in my ſelf, while I have to do with ſuch love, and ſuch love is the ſpring of all Chriſt's deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with me, and Carriages towards me.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Fifth Goſpel-principle or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Faith, which thou ſhouldeſt bear up thy ſelf upon, and dwell much in the contemptation of, is this: That the great deſign of Chriſt in all his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings for, and diſpenſation towards Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is the illuſtrating and enthroning of his own Grace; and the more vile, ſinful, and forlorn a wretch thou art, the more will his Grace be enthroned and illuſtrated in thine acceptance with him. Chriſt in his dealings with and for Sinners does not onely act from a principle of Soverain Grace, but in all he carrie on a deſign to enthrone that Grace of his, and to make it Glorious for ever; yea, and he acts, and will act ſutably to ſuch a deſign: 'Tis not what ſuch and ſuch Sinners do or do not deſerve (ſays Chriſt) that I am to mind, but what my Grace can do for them, and what will make moſt for the Glory of that Grace, what will ſet the brighteſt Crown upon its Head: This is evident,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94533:103"/>
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6.12.14. Which was open'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon another occaſion: Hence thoſe whom he ſaves, he ſaves in ſuch a way, as may moſt lift up his own Grace, his deſign therein being, <hi>that Grace might reigh,</hi> as you have it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. Hence you read of his <hi>juſtifying the ungodly, Rom.</hi> 4.5. He will have his Grace triumph over every Soul, whom he ſaves. Now what an encouragement is this to Faith? Chriſt not onely ſits upon a Throne of Grace, but alſo his deſign in dealing with Sinners is to ſet his Grace upon the Throne. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the more vile and ſinful thou art, the more ſutable it is to Chriſt's deſign to ſave thee; for the more vile and ſinful thou art, the greater name and Glory will his Grace get in thine acceptation and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him: The more vile and ſinful thou art, the greater will be the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace on Chriſt's part in thine acceptance and Salvation: O when Chriſt ſhall pardon a ſoul ſo guilty, receive a ſoul ſo ſinful, reconcile a ſoul that is ſuch an enemy, as thou art, how will this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Glorious riches of his Grace in the view both of men &amp; Angels? This will <hi>ſhew forth the exceeding riches of his Grace,</hi> as the the Expreſſion is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.7. And the morevile and ſinful thou art, the greater will be the admiration of Grace for ever on thy patt; <hi>Where</hi> much is forgiven, there will be the return of much Love, much praiſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. O, who am I (ſayes
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94533:103"/>the ſoul, when once received to mercy, though more then ordinary vile and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) who am I, that I ſhould find Grace in Chriſt's ſight? What, ſuch a rebell, and yet pardon'd? Such an enemy, and yet reconcil'd? Such a Black devil, and yet waſht, and made white in the Blood of the Lamb? Such a Fiend of Hell, and yet made a Favourite of Heaven? Such a filthy, deformed wretch, and yet taken into the pure and Lovely Boſome of ſweet Jeſus? O Grace, Grace! How rich and free is Grace? And O what praiſe and <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> will there be tuned upon the Tongues and ſpirits of ſuch to God and the Lamb for ever? When therefore thou wouldſt go to Chriſt, and diſcouragements ariſe to keep thee back from him, thou ſhouldſt dwell in the thoughts of and bear up thy ſoul upon this conſideration, reaſoning thus with thy ſelf: True I am a vile wretch, the chief of Sinners, one on all accounts worthy to be abhor'd, and caſt off by Chriſt: But what then? Chriſt acts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sinners purely from a principle of Grace and Love, he regards neither wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs nor unworthineſs; whether a great ſinner or a little ſinner, 'tis all one to him, as to his accepting of me: Moreover his deſign is to Crown his Grace, and render that Glorious; and the more vile I am, the more that deſign of his will take in mine acceptation and Salvation: How vile there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſoever I am, I will caſt my ſelf upon
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94533:104"/>him, and put in for an Eſpouſal with him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth Goſpel-principle or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Faith, which thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bear up thy ſelf upon, and dwell much in the contemplation of, is this: That 'tis the Glory and perfection of Chriſt as Mediator to receive Sinners, and to give out himſelf and his fulneſs to them, when they come to him: This, if rightly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will mightily help on Faith, and liſt the poor ſoul over his diſcouragements in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Boſome and embraces of Jeſus Chriſt: To underſtand it aright you muſt know, that Chiſt has a two-fold Glory and perfection: The Glory and perfection of his Perſon, as he is the Son of God; and the Glory and perfection of his office, as he is Mediator and head of the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: the Glory and perfection of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the Son of God, that is infinitly compleat and full, that admits neither of diminution nor augmentation, being unchangeably the ſame for ever: But the Glory and pefection of his Office, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, that in a great meaſure ariſes from his receiving Sinners, and beſtowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Grace upon them, when they come to him; and the more Sinners he receives, and the more Grace he gives out to them, the greater his Glory and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this reſpect is: and it may be truly ſaid, that Chriſt in receiving, and giving our Grace to Sinners, when they
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94533:104"/>come to him, does increaſe the revenue of his own Glory, and more and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect himſelf, as head and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: Hence the <hi>Church</hi> is called <hi>his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ, Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>God gave him to be head over all things to the Church which is his Body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all:</hi> Now if the Church is Chriſts fulneſs, then the more that is filled and compleated by his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sinners to himſelf, and giving out Grace to them; the more full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat he himſelf, as to his Mediatorie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and perfection growes: Hence alſo Saints are ſaid to be <hi>the Glory of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.23. As Chriſt alone is their glory, ſo they alſo are his glory: And how his glory? Not onely becauſe they do, or ſhould actually glorifie him; but alſo becauſe he has received them, and laid out his grace upon them; and 'tis his grace onely that ſhines forth in them: Hence that obſervation of <hi>Galvin</hi> upon the place. <hi>They</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that excell moſt in grace and holineſs,</hi>

                  <hi>they peculiarly are the glory of Chriſt; becauſe they have nothing but by free gift from Chriſt:</hi> Hence alſo Chriſt tells us, that <hi>he is Glorified in them,</hi> Jo. 17.10. And he ſayes Expreſly <hi>that the Spirit ſhall Glorifie him, becauſe he ſhall receive of his, and give it unto us,</hi> Jo. 16.14. By all which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that 'tis the glory and perfection of Chriſt, as Mediator, to receive Sinners,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94533:105"/>coming to him, and to beſtow himſelf and his grace upon them: In ſhort, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, all that ever Chriſt has done for, and is made of God to, poor Sinners; all his acts, and all his offices, as Mediator, do receive their ultimate perfection in their ſull influences on us and our Salvation: And as Chriſt receives his name and Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a Saviour from his Relation to, and acting for poor Sinners to redeem and ſave them; ſo the perfection of this office, and thoſe acts of his do lye in the full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of our Salvation: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they would all be but vain and weak acts, ſhould he not fully ſave us, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. O what encouragement is here to Faith, and how muſt unbelief ſink, and die before this conſideration, if rightly improv'd? True (may the ſoul ſay) I am vile, ſinful, and unworthy; but 'tis the honour of Chriſt to receive me; 'tis his glory to beſtow himſelf and his grace upon me; 'tis his prefection, as Mediator, to accept and ſave me, and ſuch, as I am; and therefore why ſhould I be diſcouraged? I will go to him, and caſt my ſelf upon him: Thus bear up your ſouls upon, and encourage your Faith with theſe Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principles, which is greatly neceſſary, and will not a little conduce to an Eſpouſal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Would'ſt thou indeed be Eſpous'd to Chriſt? Then take heed of all jealouſies of him, and prejudices againſt him; and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94533:105"/>be ſure ever to maintain right thoughts of him. One of the great deſigns of Satan, and one of the moſt curſed workings of unbelief, is to prejudice ſouls againſt Chriſt, and to fill them with hard, jealous thoughts of him; which if they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in, they infallibly keep the ſoul from cloſing with him in a Marriage-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. If a woman has jealouſies and hard thoughts of a man, and be filled with prejudices againſt him, ſhe is never like to enter into a Marriage-Covenant with him: And no more will a ſoul cloſe with Chriſt in a Marriage-Covenant, as long as he is filled with hard thoughts of him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt him: Watch therefore againſt this: The Devil, together with the unbelief of our own hearts, will frame up a thouſand ſtrange Notions and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of Chriſt in the ſoul, thereby to prejudice us againſt Chriſt; but take heed of all theſe, and be ſure to maintain right thoughts and apprehenſions of him; particularly here take onely two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be ſure to maintain honorable thoughts of his Perſon: Look upon him as a Perſon of glory, and as having all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies in him: 'Tis the work, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of unbelief to darken and obſcure the Perſon of Chriſt, to make that appear vile and contemptible in the eye of the ſoul, whereby it does effectually ſtrengthen it ſelf with in him; and indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94533:106"/>more prevalent to keep the ſoul from Chriſt, then an ignorance of, or prejudice againſt his Perſonal worth and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: This was that which made the Jewes ſo generally reject him: <hi>They ſaw no Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in him for which they ſhould deſire him, nor did they diſcern form or comlineſs in him;</hi> and therefore rejected him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1, 2. They Look't no ſurther then the outward form, the veil of his fleſh; they ſaw not his Divine Beauty and glory; and ſo deſpiſed him: And, my beloved, unleſs we look within this veil, and come to view and contemplate him, as a Perſon of glory, we alſo ſhall reject him to our eternal perdition.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94533:106"/>always maintain honorable thoughts of his Perſon: <hi>Behold his glory, as the glory of the onely begotten of the Father,</hi> and beg him more and more to reveal his Perſonal worth, and excellencies to thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be ſure always to maintain good thoughts of his ways, Kingdom, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: Admit not of one jealouſie of Chriſt, as if he were an hard, ſevere Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; as if he carried it with rigour and ſeverity towards his ſpouſes: If the Devil and unbelief fail in their other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, then they endeavour to prejudice ſouls againſt Chriſt, perſwading them, that he is an hard Maſter, an auſtere Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that rules with intolerable rigour and ſeverity: I know, ſayes he in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>that thou waſt an auſtere man,</hi> Mat. 25.24. And hereby the ſoul is ſeared off from Chriſt: But, ſoul, as ever thou would'ſt be Eſpous'd to him, take heed of any ſuch jealouſie of him, or prejudice againſt him, keeping up good thoughts of him and his ways, him and his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and be much in contemplating the ſweetneſs both of him and his wayes: Is he ſevere? Pray, where lies his ſeverity? Does he call you to bear his Yoak? He does, but 'tis an eaſie yoak: Does he enjoin you to bear his Burthen? He does, but 'tis a light Burthen: <hi>My yoak is eaſie, and my Burthen is light,</hi> Mat. 11.29.30. Does he expect you ſhould take up the Croſſe?

The Apoſtle ſpeaking but
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94533:108"/>of one truth concerning Chriſt, tells us 'tis <hi>worthy of all acceptation,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.16. And if ſo, what acceptation muſt Chriſt himſelf, yea Chriſt, withall his truths, and all his treaſures both, be worthy of? And how ſhould our ſouls cleave to him, &amp; take him into our embraces? There are among others five things which ſpeak a good to be eminently grateful and acceptable: worth and excellency: uſefulneſs and ſerviceableneſs: ſutableneſs and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency: Sweetneſs and delight: Durable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unchangableneſs in all; all which are ſound in Chriſt, who tenders himſelf and his Love to us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is worth and excellency in Chriſt, yea, incomparable worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: The Apoſtle ſpeaks of an excelling excellency that there is in the knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. Now the knowledge of Chriſt is ſo excellent, becauſe Chriſt is excellent: Chriſt indeed is all worth, all excellency: He is an infinite Ocean of Beauty and glory; <hi>he is the chiefeſt among ten Thouſand, and all together lovely.</hi> Cant. 5.10 16. All excellencies dwell in him, as in their proper Fountain, and they all meet, and are united in him, as lines in their proper center: Some beauty, ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies you find ſcatter'd up and down among the creatures; the Saints, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the Sun, Moon, and Starrs, and the like: But alas! Tis ſcatter'd, and 'tis ſcatter'd but here and there a drop; but in Chriſt you have all Beauty, all
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94533:108"/>worth, all excellency in a bleſſed Union and conjunction: You have all in one, and that unchangeably. O what a portion is Chriſt (ſayes one) O that the Saints would dig deeper into the treaſures of his wiſdom and excellencies: Truly 'tis ſweet digging there, and there, in ſome ſort, there will be room for digging to all eternity; for even through eternity new wonders of glory will ariſe, new Beauties and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies will appear, and ſhine forth in Chriſt: What ſhall I ſay? He has in him all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of both worlds; and is indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly the wonder of both: In him there is a confluence of all the lovely properties, the drawing attributes, the raviſhing Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Bright-ſhining and glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the infinitely bleſſed Deity: Hence, ſayes he, <hi>all that the Father hath is mine;</hi> which may be underſtood of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.15.

And how great a wickedneſs is it to reject him? I can't but here take up the complaint of an holy man: O pity, pity for evermore (ſayes he) that there ſhould be ſuch an one, as Chriſt Jeſus, ſo boundleſs, ſo bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs, ſo incomparable, ſo infinite in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and ſweetneſs, and ſo few that will take him: they miſerably loſe their love (ſayes he) who will not beſtow it upon this lovely one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is uſefulneſs and ſerviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Chriſt: As Chriſt is a perſon of the higheſt excellency, ſo of the greateſt and moſt abſolute need, uſe, and ſervice to poor ſouls: Indeed he is <hi>the one needful good,</hi> Lu. 10.42. Chriſt is ſo much need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, and of ſo much uſe and ſervice to poor ſouls, that they can't poſſibly do well, and be happy without him: Pray, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, we provoke God, and he is angry with us; and by Chriſt alone 'tis, that we <hi>receive the attonement.</hi> Rom. 5.11. We ſin, and load our ſelves with guilt; and by Chriſt alone 'tis, that we are or can be diſcharged from it: <hi>In him have we redemption through his Blood, even the for giveneſs of ſins,</hi> Eph. 1.7. We have an hard and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent heart, an heart that cannot repent;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94533:109"/>and by Chriſt, and Chriſt alone 'tis, that we can obtain repentance, <hi>he being exalted to give repentance unto Iſratl, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins,</hi> Act. 5.31. We are at a dreadſul diſtance from God, <hi>afar off</hi> (as the Scripture ſpeaks) and by Chriſt and him alone 'tis, that <hi>we are made nigh:</hi> What ſhall I ſay? The beſt of Saints, as well as the worſt of Sinners, have an abſolute need of Chriſt, and he is of daily uſe and ſervice to them; neither can they live one day or one hour without him: Indeed he is their life, and without him therefore they are dead and undone, as well as others: <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him they can do nothing,</hi> Jo. 15.5. Without him every duty will be too hard, every burthen will be too heavy, every temptation will be too ſtrong, every luſt will be too mighty for them: without him they would yet ſall ſhort of the eternal reſt, and would make ſhip-wrack of Faith, ſouls, and all for ever. Without him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saints, nor Sinners can have any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to God, any intercourſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, in which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole of our happineſs both in time and eternity lies. <hi>I am the way</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and no man cometh to the Father, but by m,</hi> Jo. 14.6. <hi>And through him,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apoſtle, we have acceſs unto the Father by one Spirit,</hi> Eph, 2.18. Without him we could have no peace with God; <hi>for he alone is our peace,</hi> Eph. 2.14. And having peace with God, without him we could not maintain our peace one hour, it being he alone that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94533:110"/>is <hi>our advocate and propitiation with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 1 Jo. 2.1, 2. Thus he is every way moſt needful, and moſt uſeful to eternal ſouls: O how grateful, how acceptable then is he, or ought he to be to us?</p>
               <p n="3">3 There is ſutableneſs and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency alſo in Chriſt to the ſouls of men: The ſutableneſs and conveniency of any good renders it acceptable to us: How acceptable is bread to an hungry man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a good ſutable to him? How ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable is drink to a thirſty man, becauſe a good ſuitable to him? Now there is an admirable ſutableneſs and conveniency in Chriſt to the ſouls of men, and that in all the caſes of them: Why then ſhould he not be acceptable to them? One (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) repreſents the ſutableneſs of Chriſt to the ſouls and wants of Sinners thus, the whole perſon, nature, and offices of Chriſt (ſayes he) are ſo ſuited and proportioned to all the varity of needs in us, that they are as a key for a lock, there is ward for ward, every thing done in the key ſutable to the lock: and indeed ſo 'tis here, Chriſt and his fulneſs being exactly ſuited to us and our wants: We are ſick, and ſick to death, and Chriſt is a Phyſitian, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12. And what more ſutable to the ſick then a Phyſitian? We are ſinful, and ſinful to damnation, we are loſt Sinners, and Chriſt is a Saviour; and who or what more ſutable to loſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then a Saviour? We are poor cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94533:110"/>the captives of ſin and Sathan, in bondage to death and the curſe; and Chriſt is a Redeemer; and who or what more ſutable to Captives then a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Weare under the Tyranny and Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many mighty, powerful Luſts, Luſts that are impoſing upon us every hour, and we are no way able to deal with them: But Chriſt is a great and puiſſant King, who can ſubdue all, and whoſe Arrows ſhall be ſharp in the hearts of all his and our Enemies; and what more ſutable to Perſons in ſuch a circumſtance then ſuch a King? We are dead, and Chriſt is Life; and what more ſutable for the Dead then Life? We are poor, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and Chriſt is gold to enrich us. Are we naked? Chirſt is Cloathing for us: Are we blind? He is Eye-ſalve for us: Are we in Priſon? He is Liberty: Are we Hungry? He is Bread: Are we Thirſty? He is the Water of Life, which thoſe that drink of ſhall never thirſt: Are we trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled? He is Reſt: Are we drooping and deſponding? He is the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Are we bewilder'd? He is a Guide: Are we born down in our ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts? He is the Captain of our Salvation, who will fight for us: O how ſutable every way is Chriſt to ſouls, and being ſo ſutable, why ſhould he not be acceptable to us? Poor ſinner, is there any in Heaven or Earth that will ſo ſuit and anſwer the various wants and caſes of thy ſoul, as
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94533:111"/>Chriſt does and will? Why then ſhouldſt thou not account him worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation?</p>

Is there any ſo ſweet, ſo pleaſant, ſo delightful, as he? He is a Fountain of ſweetneſs, as well as Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: I find him ſo ſweet (ſayes an holy Man ſpeaking of Chriſt) that my Love, ſuppoſe I would charge it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from him, it would not obey me.

Yea, this is that will cauſe a dead Man to ſpeak and Live, as an holy Man ſpeaks concerning it. Experienced Souls will tell you, that there is more ſweetneſs in one deſcent of Love from Chriſt, then in all the delights of ſin and the Creature: This is that

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94533:113"/>For he is ſtill to come; as he was, and is, ſo he is to come, which is a ſweet word. Poor Soul, hitherto, it may be, thou haſt gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long through thy work and warfare with ſome comfort and courage; but that which damps and terrifies thee, is the apprehenſion of what may be to come.

Well, Soul, for thy encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under all, know, that whatever is to come, Chriſt is to come too: Are there Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to come? Chriſt is to come too: Are there Difficulties and Temptations to come? Chriſt is to come too: Are there Storms and Tempeſts to come? Chriſt is to come too: And while Chriſt is to come, fear not, only cloſe with him in a Marriage-Covenant, and make him thine; then come what will come, come what can come, all will be well. Thus Chriſt is every way acceptable, and infinitely acceptable; and as ever, Soul, thou wouldſt be indeed eſpouſed to him, dwell much in the ſtudy and contemplation of his accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs: Labour to be poſſeſt with a deep and daily renewed ſenſe of it, which will ſweetly draw and allure thy Soul to him.</p>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94533:113"/>great intereſting Grace; it unites us to Chriſt, and intereſts us in Chriſt: 'Tis that, as has been formerly declared and evinced, that puts Chriſt and the Soul into the boſom and embraces of each others love, and by which the Marriage-Knot is tyed between them. If ever therefore thou wouldſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed eſpouſed unto him, look well to thy Faith, ſee that thou doſt pitch that aright upon him, cloſing with him, and embracing of him; not by halves, but throughly; not feignedly, but intimately and cordially.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94533:114"/>accompliſhments: Hence, ſayes Chriſt, <hi>If any man will come after me,</hi> believe on me, be eſpouſed to me, <hi>let him deny himſelf,</hi> Mat. 16.24. <hi>Let him deny himſelf,</hi> renounce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, go out of himſelf, let Self become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with him: And indeed, the Soul that believes in Chriſt, does go quite out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſees and feels himſelf to be a poor empty Nothing in all reſpects, he ſees and finds his Strength to be Weakneſs, his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Folly, his Beauty Blackneſs, his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs Sin, his All Nothing: And thus muſt we, if ever we indeed believe and get Union with Chriſt. O, my Beloved, one of the great things which ſtands between Faith and us, Chriſt and us, is Self: This indeed is the Souls Darling, the firſt Born (as one calls it) of his Love and Delights, and he is loth to part with it; but part with it he muſt, and renounce it he muſt, or he can never believe aright, nor is he ever like to have any part or lot in Chriſt: Every ſtep out of Self is a ſtep towards Chriſt, and Faith in Chriſt; and we muſt be divorced from the one, if ever we be married to the other: particularly you muſt quit and renounce Self, eſpecially in this three-fold Notion; Self-Will, Self-Worth, Self-Intereſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You muſt quit and renounce Self-Will: He that indeed believes, muſt in a ſort have no Will of his own, but his Will muſt be wholly melted and reſigned up into the Will of Chriſt: Hence the <hi>Church</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>ſubject unto Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 5.24. We are apt
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94533:114"/>to live in our own Wills, and are exceeding fond of, and ſet upon having our Wills, and that how croſs and contrary ſoever they be to the Will of Chriſt: But if ever we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo as to get union with Chriſt, our ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Wills muſt bow, our proud Wills muſt down, and muſt in all things, as much as is poſſible, be refer'd and reſign'd into Chriſt's Will: and good reaſon, for his Will is the rule of goodneſs, as well as the firſt cauſe of all things: We muſt not think to ſay, we are Lords, but we muſt bow to Chriſt as the great and only Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt quit and renounce Self-Worth, Self-Rightcouſneſs; you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Worth and Righteouſneſs of your own in point of juſtification and acceptation with God. 'Tis a great word which I ſhall ſpeak, Mens duties, living under the Goſpel, keep almoſt as many from Chriſt and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as their ſins do: My meaning is, as the love of ſin keeps ſome, ſo confidence in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, a confidence in Self-Worth, Self-Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, keeps multitudes of others from Chriſt and believing: And the truth is; my Beloved, this piece of Self is the great Idol of the Soul, and that which men are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly loth to quit and renounce; and indeed 'tis oftentimes ſo painted, and, as it were, ſpiritualliz'd, acted with ſo much ſtate, and ſet out with ſo many ornaments, that it would make any one in love with it: but yet this Idol, ſo dear as 'tis to the Soul, muſt be denyed and renounced, this Darling
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94533:115"/>muſt be caſt off, and that with loathing and abomination in reſpect of Soul-ſaving, if ever you believe, and are united to Chriſt: And the Soul that indeed does believe, looks upon himſelf to be the pooreſt, deſpicableſt, and undoneſt Creature in the World not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all; he throws away not only his Rags, but his Robes too, all his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, all his Performances, all his moral Excellencies and Attainments, as to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon them for Life and Salvation; as you know <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. of which more hereafter. The Soul's language in the Work of believing is ſuch as this; I am a poor, vile, empty nothing in my ſelf; I am nothing, I can do nothing, and I deſerve nothing; I am nothing but ſin, I can do nothing but offend and provoke God, and I deſerve nothing but frowns and death from him: If ever I be ſaved, 'tis Free Grace muſt ſave me; if ever I find favour in Gods ſight, it muſt be purely from Grace in Chriſt: Alas! I have walked contrary to God all my dayes; my heart and life both have been full of eumity and provocation againſt him, and my very Duties are damning, <hi>my beſt Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs being as filthy Rags,</hi> Iſa. 64.6. And indeed, till it comes to this with us, we are like to remain ſtrangers to Chriſt, and Faith in Chriſt. I ſhall only ſay this further as to this particular, That no men in the World are further off from Chriſt, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him through believing, then ſuch as truſt in their own Worth, their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94533:115"/>Chriſt himſelf tells us, That <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Harlots do enter the Kingdom of Heaven before ſuch,</hi> Mat. 21.31.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt quit and renounce Self-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; that is to ſay, you muſt be at a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing point with all, you muſt be willing to forgo all your outward intereſts and concerns for Chriſt, when he calls you to it, thinking nothing too much or too good for him: this Chriſt is expreſs in, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me: And he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> And again, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.33. <hi>Whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my Diſciple.</hi> In a word, the meaning is not, that all that come to Chriſt muſt actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally forſake all thoſe things, and deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as to the enjoyment of them; but the meaning is, (firſt) that we muſt have a very diminutive love for theſe in compariſon of Chriſt. And (ſecondly) that we muſt be at a parting point with all for Chriſt's ſake, and at Chriſt's call. And truly, 'tis but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we ſhould be ſo; he that actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo much for us, does highly deſerve that we ſhould be in a readineſs to part with our little All for him: Thus we muſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quit and renounce our ſelves, if we would indeed believe and have union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Would you pitch your Faith aright upon Chriſt, and be indeed eſpouſed to him? then labour to get a right notion and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94533:116"/>of him, as the great object of Faith. One great reaſon why many fail and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their Faith, and ſo fall ſhort of Chriſt, is their ignorance of him; they have not a right notion and apprehenſion of Chriſt, as the great object of Faith; and indeed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Chriſt be rightly known and apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, we are never like to pitch our Faith aright upon him: <hi>How ſhall they believe</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>in him, of whom they have not heard?</hi> Rom. 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they believe? i. e.</hi> Men cannot believe aright on one that has not been reveal'd and made known to them: a blind, ignorant Faith, is never like to reach union and communion with Chriſt; and, my Beloved, if we would believe aright on Chriſt, we muſt know him aright, and apprehend him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.<note place="margin">Dei cognitio eadem eſt cum Fide, quâ inſiti in Chriſti Corpus, divinae adoptionis conſortes, &amp; Caelorum hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redes eſſicimur. <hi>Calv. in loc.</hi>
                  </note> Faith, in Scripture, is ſometimes expreſt by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. Not that knowledge alone is all that is requiſite to Faith; but it notes thus much to us, that the knowledge of Chriſt is ſuch a requiſite to believing, that there can be no true believing without it: Hence alſo Chriſt ſpeaks of <hi>ſeeing the Son, and believing on him;</hi> ſeeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believing, and ſeeing in order to believing: <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, That</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Quiſquis videt Filium &amp; credit in eum.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>whoſoever ſeeth the Son and believeth on him, ſhould
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94533:116"/>have everlaſting life,</hi> John 6.40. By <hi>ſeeing the Son,</hi> here we are to underſtand the true Knowledge of Chriſt: Hence alſo they that come to Chriſt, and believe ſavingly on him, are ſaid, in order thereunto, <hi>to be taught of God, and to have heard, and learn't of the Father,</hi> John 6.45. And, pray, what have they been <hi>taught</hi> of God? what have they <hi>learn't</hi> of him, but the knowledge of Chriſt, as the great object of Faith? at leaſt this is one great leſſon, which all that believe do and muſt learn. As ever therefore you would pitch your Faith aright upon Chriſt, labour to know and apprehend him aright; labour to know and apprehend him, as he is revealed and offered in the Goſpel. Particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. View and apprehend him in his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Divine Nature: The Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals him in his Divinity, it propounds him to our Faith, as God, <hi>the true God, the great God, the mighty God, God over all;</hi> and thus ſhould Faith eye and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him:<note place="margin">Fatetur <hi>Thomas</hi> Chriſtum eſſe Dominum ſuum; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ende altius conſcendit, ac Deum quoque nominat; fides ejus evehitur ad aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Chriſts divinitatem. <hi>Calv. in loc.</hi>
                  </note> Thus <hi>Thomas</hi> his Faith apprehended him, when he ſaid, <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> John 20.28. And indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a God-head, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, eternal, unchangable God-head is a Foundation ſtrong enough for Faith to build upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. View and apprehend him in his Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Relation; not only as God, but alſo as God the Son, and ſo as diſtinguiſh't from the Father: Thus the Goſpel reveals and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:94533:117"/>him to our Faith, and thus alſo ſhould our Faith view and apprehend him: Thus <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith, with the reſt in whoſe name he ſpake, did eye and apprehend him, John 6.69. <hi>We believe, and are ſure</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the living God:</hi> There is a diſtinct honour due to every Perſon in the Sacred Trinity; and the more diſtinctly our Faith eyes and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends Chriſt in his Perſonal Relation, as Son, the more compleat it is, and the more it gives him the honour of that Relation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. View and apprehend him in his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or as the Son of God incarnate: The Goſpel reveals and propounds Chriſt as the object of Faith, to us, not ſimply as God, and as God the Son, but as God the Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, as <hi>the Word made Fleſh,</hi> John 1.14. or as <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. As having taken humane nature into perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal union with himſelf, and ſo is both God and Man in one perſon; and thus alſo ſhould Faith eye and apprehend him: <hi>You believe in God,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>believe alſo in me,</hi> Joh. 1.14. Hence alſo he ſpeaks ſo often of <hi>eating his Fleſh, and drinking his Blood,</hi> and of <hi>giving his Fleſh for the life of the World;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all tells us,<note place="margin">Tune vitam in Chriſto invenies, ſivitae materiam quaeras in ejus carne. Nam ſicut aeternus Dei Sermo fons vitae eſt, ita caro ejus veluti canalis, vitam, quae intrinſeca (ut loquuntur) in Divinitate reſidet, ad nes diſſundit. <hi>Calv.</hi>
                  </note> that his <hi>Fleſh is Meat indeed, and his Blood Drink indeed,</hi> Joh. 6.51, 53, 54, 55, 56. By all which he ſignifies to us, that our Faith muſt reſpect and apprehend him as Man, as well as God;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:94533:117"/>as the Son incamate; and indeed thus he is the next and moſt immediate object of Faith: The God-head or Divinity is the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate object of Faith; but Chriſt, the Son incarnate, is the next and moſt immediate object of Faith: Hence we are faid <hi>by him to believe in God,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.21.<note n="*" place="margin">A Chriſto homine nos deducimur ad Chriſtum Deum.</note> Faith firſt eyes Chriſt as Man, or the Son incarnate, and by him comes ultimately to object it ſelf upon God: The humanity is <hi>janua ad Divinitatem,</hi> (as one ſpeaks of it) <hi>a Gate to the Divinity,</hi> that by which our Faith paſſes to the God-head:<note place="margin">Neque ad Chriſtum Deum unquam perveniet, qui he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem negligit.</note> 
                  <hi>And</hi> (as a great Divine ſpeaks) <hi>he that comes not to Chriſt as man, ſhall never come to him as God:</hi> The truth is, Faith cannot deal with God immediately, but as God cloath'd with our nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. View and apprehend him in his office of Mediatorſhip: The Goſpel reveals and propounds Chriſt to our Faith in his Office, it propounds and reveals him as Chriſt, as the true Meſſiah and Saviour of the World, as one ſeal'd, ſent, and anointed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the redemption of loſt Souls, and thus alſo ſhould Faith eye and apprehend him: So alſo did <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith apprehend him: <hi>Thou art Chriſt</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the Son of the living God,</hi> Mat. 16.16. Hence we read of <hi>believing that Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> 1 John 5.1. Hence alſo Chriſt tells the Jews, <hi>If ye believe not, that I am he, ye ſhall die in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:94533:118"/>your ſins,</hi> John 8.24. <hi>If ye believe not, that I am he, i. e.</hi> that I am the Meſſiah, the Chriſt, the Saviour that was promiſed. O! Faith is ſhort of that notion it ſhould have of Chriſt, unleſs it thus eyes him in his Office.</p>
               <p n="5">5. View and apprehend him in his infinite ability and ſufficiency for the diſcharge of his Office: The Goſpel reveals and propounds him to our Faith, as one <hi>able to ſave to the very uttermoſt;</hi> and accordingly ſhould our Faith eye and apprehend him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. It reveals him indeed both as an onely and alſufficient Saviour: as an onely Saviour; <hi>Look unto me, and be ſaved, all ye ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides me,</hi> Iſa. 45.22. <hi>Neither is there Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any other; nor is there any other Name given under Heaven, wherby we may be ſaved, but his only,</hi> Acts 4.12. And as an alſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Saviour; <hi>My Fleſh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me,</hi> John 6.55, 57. It reveals him in the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite vertue of his Blood, the inexhauſtible fulneſs of his Grace, the compleatneſs of his Obedience, the excellency of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the perfection of his Satisfaction, and the like; and thus ſhould our Faith eye and apprehend him. O labour for ſuch a notion and apprehenſion of Chriſt as this is: as ever you would believe aright, and be indeed eſpouſed to Chriſt, labour for a found, clear, diſtinct knowledge of him, as the great object of Faith: Pray much for <hi>a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:94533:118"/>Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him;</hi> that was the Apoſtles prayer for the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in this caſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. and let it be yours for your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Would you pitch your Faith aright upon Chriſt, and be indeed eſpouſed to him? Then be ſure to make a right choice or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of him, being thus known and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. To have a right notion and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Chriſt, is good and neceſſary, in order to union with him by believing but 'tis not enough; no, Chriſt being known and apprehended, muſt alſo be choſen and embraced by us, and that as he is revealed and offered in the Goſpel. To know and apprehend Chriſt, is an act of the Mind or Underſtanding; but to chuſe and embrace Chriſt, is an act of the Will and Affections; and though Faith has its riſe and inchoation in the mind, yet its complement and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it has in the Will and Affections; theſe liking, chuſing, and embracing of him, and that in a way ſutable to what the mind ſees and apprehends concerning him; and this muſt be added to the former, or there is no right believing, and ſo no conjugal union and communion with Chriſt:<note place="margin">Obſervemus, fidei ſedem non in cerebro eſſe, ſed in corde; &amp; quoniam cordis nomen pro ſerio et ſincero affectu fere capitur; dice firmam eſſe &amp; efficacem fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciam, non nudam tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum notionem. <hi>Calv.</hi>
                  </note> Hence that of the Apoſtle, <hi>With the heart Man believeth unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10.10. True believing then is with the Heart; now by the Heart here, as alſo generally elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94533:119"/>in Scripture, is meant the Will and Aſſections; accordingly to believe with the Heart, is for the Will and Affections to chuſe and embrace Chriſt, as he is revealed and offered in the Goſpel; this is called <hi>a receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt,</hi> John 1.12. We receive Chriſt into our Wills, when we chuſe him, and adhere to him for Life and Salvation; and we receive him into our affections, when we love him, deſire him, and delight in him; and this is believing: <hi>To believe,</hi> ſayes <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, is nothing elſe but to chuſe and embrace Chriſt with a ſincere affection of mind, as he is reveal'd and offer'd in the Goſpel:</hi> And this indeed is the great vital act of Faith, and that whereby our Conjugal-Union and Communion with Chriſt is more eſpecially brought about: This is that which makes Chriſt ours, and puts us into the poſſeſſion of him: <hi>Mary,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>has choſen the better part, which ſhall never be taken from her,</hi> Luke 10.42. She had choſen Chriſt, and her choice of him had made him her own, and ſo her own, as that ſhe could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſe him, never be deprived of him: Indeed a right choice of Chriſt makes him ours, it unites us to him, and intereſts us in him for ever. A little further to help you in this buſineſs, know that a right choice of Chriſt is accompliſh't by theſe three ſteps.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul apprehending Chriſt (as before) likes him, and approves of him, as the beſt and moſt ſutable Saviour, the moſt lovely and deſirable object in Heaven or
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94533:119"/>Earth: The Soul ſayes of Chriſt, as they did of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Numb. 14.7. <hi>The Land</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is an exceeding good Land:</hi> So this Chriſt, ſayes the Soul, is an exceeding good Chriſt, this Saviour is an exceeding good Saviour; there's none like him, there's no beauty like his Beauty, no blood like his Blood, no fulneſs like his Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no love like his Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul deſires him, and longs after him, and that with a ſtrong, ardent, and vigorous affection: This is call'd <hi>hungring and thirſting after Chriſt,</hi> Matth. 5.6. The Soul ſeeing Chriſt, and approving of him, longingly cries out; O a Chriſt, a Chriſt! O that this good Chriſt were mine!</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul is by Grace ſweetly and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully determined upon Chriſt; ſo as actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to make a ſolemn and deliberate choice of him, ſingling him out from all other things in Heaven and Earth, as the beſt and moſt deſirable good, and moſt worthy of his deareſt and moſt intimate embraces: The Soul now pitches his choice upon Chriſt to be his Head and Husband, his Lord, and Saviour, his reſt, his treaſure, his happineſs, his all for ever: Now by theſe ſteps, ſee that you come up to make a right choice of Chriſt; be ſure that you like him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of him, as the beſt and moſt deſirable object in Heaven or Earth: Truly if you view him aright, you can't but like him, and approve of him as ſuch: See that the deſire of your Souls be indeed towards him above
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94533:120"/>all others: View him, till you fall in love with him, yea, till you fall ſick of love for him; and be ſure not to reſt, till you get your Wills ſweetly and powerfully determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, ſo determined upon him, as to make a free, ſolemn, deliberate choice of him, paſſing by all other Lovers, and taking him alone into the boſom and embraces of your Faith and Love. Now that you may be ſure to make a right choice of Chriſt, ſuch a choice of Chriſt as may make him yours; and tie the Marriage Knot between him and you, obſerve herein theſe five or ſix great Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be ſure that, you chuſe and embrace Chriſt himſelf, and not ſomewhat elſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of him. 'Tis a great and awakening ſaying which a worthy Divine has; <hi>Many now,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>take Chriſt by gueſs; but be ſure that it be he, and onely he whom ye em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace: his ſweet Smell, his lovely Voice, his fair Face, his gracious working in the Soul will ſoon tell if it be he or no.</hi> So ſay I, be ſure that it be he; many miſtake the Object, they cloſe with ſomewhat elſe inſtead of Chriſt; at beſt, they chuſe Chriſt's Portion, his Benefits, his Priviledges, his Purchaſes, but not his Perſon: But my advice, to you is, pitch on nothing ſhort of the Perſon of Chriſt, then is our Raith beyond all doubt rightly pitch't upon Chriſt, when Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not his Benefits and Priviledges onely, are choſen and embraced by us. A Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, if right, is between Perſon and Perſon,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:94533:120"/>not between Perſon and Portion, Perſon and Eſtate, that being a reſulting thing: So here in this Spiritual-Marriage, Faith does not marry the Soul to the Portion, Benefits, and Priviledges of Chriſt, but to Chriſt himſelf. True, I don't ſay (firſt) but that true Faith gives the Soul an intereſt in all the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, Priviledges, and Purchaſes of Chriſt: Nor (ſecondly) do I ſay, that the Soul may not have an eye to theſe, and a reſpect to theſe in his choice of, and cloſe with Chriſt; yea, uſually theſe are the firſt thing that Faith has in its eye: The firſt thing the Soul looks at, and is taken with, when he is drawn to Chriſt, uſually is that Peace, that Pardon, that Righteouſneſs, that deliverance from Sin, Death, and Hell, which he ſees is found and treaſured up in Chriſt for Souls: But though theſe things be ſo, yet the Soul does, and muſt go higher, he muſt look at, and pitch upon the Perſon of Chriſt, or his Faith is not ſo right and compleat as it ought to be. Alas! 'tis the Perſon of Chriſt that is the great Fountain of all Grace, and all Manifeſtations from God to us; and Faith accordingly does cloſe in with his Perſon: The Spouſes Faith ſeems ſo to do, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. She had her eye upon the perſonal Beauty and Glory of Chriſt, and accordingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him with her Faith and Love: Hence alſo you have ſo often thoſe expreſſions; <hi>I ſought him whom my Soul loved; and ſaw you him whom my Soul loveth?</hi> Her love, and ſo her Faith was fixt upon Chriſt himſelf: and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94533:121"/>thus do you fix your Faith and Love upon him; ſo ſhall you be ſure not to miſs of a Conjugal-Union and Communion with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be ſure that you chuſe a whole Chriſt, and not a part of him only: My meaning is, ſee that you chuſe and embrace Chriſt in all his Offices, as a King as well as a Prieſt, as a Lord as well as a Saviour; and as in all his Offices, ſo for all thoſe ends and uſes for which God has deſigned him, and the Goſpel revealed him to us; for Holineſs, as well as Righteouſneſs; for Sanctification, as well as Juſtification. I need not tell you, that Chriſt is a Lord and King as well as a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and that as ſuch he is revealed and offered in the Goſpel to our Faith: <hi>Him hath God exalted a Prince and Saviour to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto Iſrael, and remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 5.31. and they that will have him, as a Saviour to give them pardon, muſt have him as a Prince to give them repentance: And you know Chriſt's Reſt and his Yoke go together in the Goſpel-Offer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29. Nor need I tell you, that God has appointed him, and the Goſpel reveals him to be our Sanctification as well as our Juſtification: So you have it expreſly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, then do we chuſe Chriſt, and embrace him aright, when we chuſe and embrace him under each notion; when we chuſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him not as a Saviour only, but as a Lord too; not onely as a Prieſt to procure pardon and reconciliation for us, but alſo as a Prince, to rule, govern, and command
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94533:121"/>us; not only as our Righteouſneſs to juſtifie us, but as a Fountain of Grace to make us holy; and thus true Faith does chuſe and embrace him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24. <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength:</hi> Mark, Faith chuſes Chriſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Righteouſneſs, but for Strength too, Righteouſneſs for Juſtification, Strength for Holineſs and Sanctification. Chriſt's lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to the Soul, in the tender of himſelf, is ſuch as this; Poor Soul, thou art in a dead, loſt, undone condition, God is wroth with thee, Hell gapes for thee, Juſtice calls aloud for vengeance againſt thee, and there is no hope, no help, no ſalvation for thee, but in and by me, and union with me: And loe! I am willing to beſtow my ſelf, with all my fulneſs upon thee: But remember this, that I'le rule and command thee: If I be thy Saviour, I'le be thy Lord and King too: If thou wilt ſhare in my Redemption, thou muſt be content to bear my Yoke, to bow to my Scepter, to ſubmit to my Laws and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Accordingly, Faith's anſwer, if right, is this; Content, Lord, 'tis but fit, that he that Saves ſhould rule and reign, that he that Redeems ſhould be bowed and ſubmitted to; and I do willingly give up my ſelf to thy holy and ſpiritual Government, thy Yoke is eaſie, thy Scepter is Righteouſs, thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is full of Peace and Joy, and I deſire to come under them: I would have thee to make me holy, as well as righteous; to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due this rebellious heart of mine, and to rule
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94533:122"/>in me by thy pure Spirit, as well as to ſave me by thy perfect obedience: O ſee, that thus you chuſe and embrace whole Chriſt, elſe your Faith is not right, nor are you like to attain unto a Conjugal-Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be ſure that you chuſe Chriſt ſingly and alone, and not joyn ſomewhat elſe with him: Some are for compounding with Chriſt, they would joyn ſomewhat elſe in Partnerſhip with him; but as Chriſt muſt not be divided, ſo neither will he be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, he will be all, or nothing at all to Souls; and ſo true Faith cloſes with him: Hence <hi>with the new Creature Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>all, and in all,</hi> Col. 3.11. The <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> (as one obſerves) had many of them a Wife and a Concubine, but it is not ſo here; no, as Faith chuſes a whole Chriſt, ſo it chuſes a naked Chriſt, Chriſt ſingly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, without joyning any thing elſe in Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip with him: It matches the Soul to Chriſt with an abſolute excluſion of all other Matches: Indeed Faith ſees enough in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Chriſt, a naked Chriſt, without the help of any thing elſe, and accordingly chuſes and embraces him: And ſo muſt your Faith chuſe and embrace him, or you are like to miſs of Conjugal-Union and Communion with him: You muſt chuſe him ſingly and alone, joyning nothing with him, and that eſpecially in the great buſineſs of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Acceptation with God: Some would fain compound with Chriſt in this buſineſs;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94533:122"/>they would have Chriſt, but they would have their own Duties too; they would have his Righteouſneſs, but they would have their own Righteouſneſs too; they would have theirs bear a ſhare with his in the point of Righteouſneſs and Juſtification before God. Thus 'twas with the Jews of old, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32. with <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. <hi>beg.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, <hi>They followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs, but attained not to the Law of Righteouſneſs:</hi> And why? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>they ſought it not by Faith, but, as it were, by the Works of the Law:</hi> and Chap. 10.3. <hi>They went about,</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, and ſubmitted not themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> Pray obſerve, (firſt) they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to, and look't for Salvation by their own Righteouſneſs. (Secondly), Though they were addicted to their own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and would fain live by it, yet they ſeemed not to cleave wholly to that, but would have Chriſt's and theirs joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>They ſought it not by Faith, but, as it were, by the Works of the Law, i. e.</hi> They were neither wholly for Chriſt, nor wholly for Self, but partly for the one, and partly for the other, joyning Self with Chriſt. And (thirdly) this left them ſhort of Righteouſneſs, Life, Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all: For 'tis ſaid, that upon this account <hi>they attained not unto the Law of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> To joyn Self with Chriſt in this Point, is as dangerous and deſtructive, as to ſet up Self againſt Chriſt. Thus (I ſay)
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94533:123"/>'twas with the Jews of old, and thus 'tis with the Papiſts now: But, my Beloved, if ever you would pitch your Faith aright up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, you muſt not once think of thus compounding the buſineſs between Him and Self; but Chriſt muſt be all in all: We muſt ſhut our eyes againſt all other things in Point of Juſtification, and muſt go forth ſingly and nakedly to Chriſt, venturing our eternal All upon the alone bottom of his everlaſting Righteouſneſs.<note place="margin">Juſtitiae Dei obtinendae principium eſt, abdicare ſe propriâ juſtitiâ. <hi>Calv.</hi>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94533:124"/>and advantage by him; for pray obſerve, there were among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſome who did <hi>miſcere Chriſtum cum Lege,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi>'s expreſſion is, <hi>they did joyn the Law with Chriſt,</hi> preſſing and taking up Circumciſion as a part of that Righteouſneſs whereby they expected to be juſtified and ſaved: They were not ſo groſs in their minds, (as that great Divine there obſerves) as to expect Salvation meerly by the obſervation of the Law, and their own Obedience; but they were for ſharing the buſineſs between this and Chriſt: Now what ſayes <hi>Paul</hi> to them, and by what does he labour to antidote the Believers among them againſt this great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror?

We are apt to look upon the Work of chuſing and embracing Chriſt, as one ſingle Act or Work onely; but, my Beloved, 'tis a Work that ſhould be often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated: by often repeating of it we ſhould grow more ſound, more ſtrong, more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in it: As a ſecond Edition corrects the Errors of the firſt, ſo after Acts of believing in this kind do ſupply the defects of the firſt Act: Indeed my advice to you is, that you would make as much conſcience of chuſing and embracing Chriſt afreſh every day, as of praying every day; eſpecially if you be either young beginners in believing, or older be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under clouds and darkneſs.

They did believe, and he would have them to believe afreſh every day; and ſo would I have you do, every day renew the firſt great Act of Faith in your cloſing with Chriſt, ſo ſhall every day be a day of eſpouſals between Chriſt and you; and ſo by degrees ſhall you come to the ſenſe and comfort of this eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. I have read of ſome who never came to a ſight and ſenſe of their Union with Chriſt till they took this courſe. Thus I have now ſhewn you the way how you may come to be eſpouſed to Chriſt, as well as what an Husband he is, what great things he does for his Spouſes, and how much his Heart is ſet upon an eſpouſal with ſinners: Now will you take this courſe? Or ſhall all be loſt with you? Poſſibly the whole will have a different effect upon thoſe that read or hear theſe things: Some, I hope, will be won and gained to Chriſt by them; others, I fear, will reject and deſpiſe all, and that either out of a ſpirit of profaneneſs, or inſenſibility of their need of, and concernedneſs in theſe things: If any Soul ſhall reject them out of a ſpirit of profaneneſs, I would ſay to ſuch a Soul, as <hi>Solomon</hi> to the Scorner, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.12. <hi>If thou ſcorneſt, thou alone ſhalt bear it;</hi> thou alone ſhalt bear all thy ſins, and all the wrath and vengeance of God due to them: If any
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94533:128"/>ſhall reject theſe things out of a Spirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility of their need of, and concern in them, their caſe is the more to be pittied; for the more inſenſible they are of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery without Chriſt, the greater is that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of theirs. <hi>What more miſerable,</hi> ſayes <hi>Auſtin,</hi>

               <p>IN the view of all that has been hitherto declared, we may well take up an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring contemplation of Chriſt's Love and Condeſcention, and Believers Comfort and Happineſs; the one and the other being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and glorious: O! for Chriſt to marry poor Souls to himſelf, and for poor Souls to be married to Chriſt, how great is the Love of the one, and the happineſs of the other herein!</p>
               <p n="1">1. How great is the Love and Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt in marrying Souls to himſelf! Next to his becoming Man, and dying for them, Wherein can he teſtifie greater Love
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:94533:129"/>and Condeſcention to them than in this? There are, among many others that might be mentioned, that will argue his Love and Condeſcention herein to be wonderful and glorious, two things. One is the infinite diſparity and diſproportion between the Parties, Him and Them; the other is the unſpeakable nearneſs and gloriouſneſs of that Union and Relation which he takes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with himſelf: Both which I deſire you to contemplate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Contemplate the infinite diſparity and diſproportion between him and them: What proportion is there between a King and a Beggar? What proportion is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Ant and an Angel; yea, between the ſmalleſt Worm, and all the Angels in Heaven? Infinitely leſs proportion is there between Chriſt and ſinners; and yet he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſes them to himſelf: What ſhall I ſay? He is both High and Great, we are baſe and vile; He is Bleſſed and Glorious, we are wretched and deſpicable: He is a Great King, we are poor ſlaves and vaſſals; yea, the worſt of ſlaves and vaſſals, being the ſlaves and vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of Sin and Satan: And to ſum up all in a few words; He is God, and we are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yea, he is an infinitely pure and holy God, and we are unſpeakably impure and unholy Creatures: O how great is the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion! and yet he marries us to himſelf: What proportion is there between God and the Creature? The Creature at beſt is but a ſmall drop of Beeing; but God is <hi>Mare eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:94533:130"/>a Sea, a Fountain, an Ocean of Beeing: The Creature is and has but a little good; but, <hi>Deus eſt Bonum inſinitiſſime infinitum,</hi> as <hi>Bradwardin</hi> ſpeaks of him, <hi>God is a moſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely infinite Good;</hi> The Creature is a depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing, the Beeing of the Creature is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Beeing, the very nature of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lies much in dependance; but God is an abſolute and independent Beeing,<note place="margin">Eſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae eſt eſſe depend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now for God to marry the Creature, and eſpouſe the Creature to himſelf; O what love, what condeſcention is this! and yet greater love than this does Chriſt ſhew: For what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is there between an infinitely Holy God, and univerſally ſinful, defiled, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Creatures? The diſtance between God and us, as we are Creatures, is great; but the diſtance between the infinitely Holy God and us, as ſinners, is in ſome ſort unſpeakably greater: 'Tis our duty, and ſhould be our joy to know and keep our Creature-diſtance with God, we ſhould rejoyce to think that God is ſo infinitely above us; but 'tis our miſery, and we ſhould tremble to think of, our ſinful diſtance from God, that diſtance I mean that ſin is, and has cauſed between God and us: Now for an Holy God to eſpouſe ſinful Creatures to himſelf; yea for a God ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Holy to eſpouſe Souls, who are ſo ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſinful, to himſelf, as the beſt of us all by nature are; this is greater love and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94533:130"/>ſtill. <hi>O wonderful commerce!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">O verè admirable commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium! tradit ſe Rex pro Servo, Deus pro Homine, Creator pro Creatura, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocens pro nocente. <hi>Bern. de paſſ. Dom.</hi>
                  </note> (ſayes one of the Ancients, ſpeaking of Chriſt's dying for his People) <hi>the King dies for the Servant, God for Man, the Creator for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the innocent for the nocent.</hi> The like may I ſay here; O wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention! The King marries a Slave, God the Creature, the pure and holy One polluted and defiled ſinners: True indeed, he makes them Saints by and upon his marrying of them, but he finds them ſinners when he firſt makes it a time of love to them: O adore this Love, this Condeſcention!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Contemplate the unſpeakable nearneſs and gloriouſneſs of that Union and Relation which he takes them into with himſelf; as the diſtance and diſproportion between the Parties is infinitely great, ſo the Union and Relation he takes them into, is very near and glorious: The Union between the Vine and Branches is near; the Union and Relation between the Head and Members is near; the Union and Relation between the Husband and Wife is near; but all theſe are but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and repreſentations of that Union and Relation which Chriſt takes Behevers into with himſelf, which muſt therefore be nearer and greater than all: 'Tis indeed (as upon occaſion has been before declared) next for intimacy and glory, to the eſſential and perſonal Union; yea, it comes ſo near the higheſt Union of all, the Union that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94533:131"/>the Father and the Son, as that it is ſet forth in Scripture by the ſame expreſſions that that Union is, <hi>viz. By being and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in each other:</hi> Yea, Chriſt himſelf ſeems to bring it ſo near that great Union, as that he makes that the pattern of it, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly prayes for it for his People, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word, that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi> Pray mark, he prayes for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of this Union for them, as the top and perfection of all their happineſs; and not only ſo, but as that which comes as near the great Union between his Father and Himſelf, as can well be conceived. 'Tis a ſweet ſaying which one of the Ancients has upon theſe words of Chriſt; <hi>What more glorious,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num in nobis; ſicut tu &amp; ego unum ſumus: Quid hac <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitate glorioſius?

                  </note> ſayes he, <hi>than this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion? What further or higher, poor Soul, canſt thou either have, or deſire to have than this, thou ſhalt be one with thy Bridegroom? O happy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding happy, yea, of all others moſt happy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion!</hi> In a word, nearer than this Creatures can't well be taken unto Chriſt, nor can they have a greater glory put upon them, then there is put upon them in their being taken into this Union &amp; Relation to him: how great therefore muſt the love and condeſcention of Chriſt herein to Believers be? O for him to take ſuch ſo near himſelf,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94533:131"/>as to make them one with him, to lay them in his boſom, to communicate himſelf to them! This is love indeed, and this we ſhould contemplate and admire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How great is the comfort and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Believers, in being thus married and eſpouſed to Chriſt? We ſay of ſuch or ſuch a Woman that is well married, that ſhe is well diſpoſed of, and is very happy in an Husband: But, O Soul, how well art thou diſpoſed of, who art diſpoſed of to Chriſt? And how happy art thou in an Husband who art married to him? What, Soul, married to Jeſus, to ſweet Jeſus, to lovely Jeſus, to Jeſus the Son of God! O what ſweet, what ſtrong conſolation may this be to thee! and how ſhould it fill thy heart with holy tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and exultation for ever? This alone may comfort thee in all the difficulties and troubles of Life, and in all the conflicts and agonies of Death. Caſt thine eye back on the nature of this Eſpouſal, and what an Husband Chriſt is, and what great things he does for his Spouſes, as the one and the other of them has been declared; and then judge of thine own happineſs, in being taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Relation to him: In <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.9. 'tis ſaid concerning the Spouſe of Chriſt, <hi>That the Daughters ſaw Her, and bleſſed Her; yea, the Queens and the Concubines, and they praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Her:</hi> They look't upon Her to be the moſt happy on Earth: And truly, Soul, when I look upon thee, as the Spouſe of Chriſt, I can't but in like manner bleſs and praiſe thee;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94533:132"/>and thou thy ſelf mayſt well bleſs thy ſelf, and ſay, Bleſſed be the day that ever I was born, bleſſed be the Womb that bare me, and bleſſed be the Paps that gave me ſuck! But yet to raiſe this comfort and happineſs of thine a little higher, that thou mayeſt rejoyce in thy Lot, the lines being fallen to thee in pleaſant places, conſider three things;</p>
               <p n="1">I. Conſider, that this Relation of thine to Chriſt, gives thee a full intereſt in him, and all that is his: This the Spouſe much gloried and rejoyced in, as her Crown and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; therefore ſhe is frequently up with it in a way of holy boaſting, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> Cant. 2.16. And again, <hi>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine,</hi> Chap. 6.3. Being eſpouſed to Chriſt, Chriſt is thine; and Chriſt being thine, his Blood is thine, his Righteouſneſs is thine, his Love is thine, his Fulneſs is thine, the Fruit of all his Sufferings, the Vertue of all his Offices, the Sweetneſs of all his Relations is thine: Chriſt being thine, all is thine, all the promiſes are thine, all the Ordinances are thine, Life is thine, Death is thine, Time is thine, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is thine, Things preſent are thine, Things to come are thine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. O what a goodly Heritage haſt thou! and how ſhould thy Soul bleſs the Lord, that ever he drew thee into this Union and Relation to him? What a ſpring of comfort may this be to thee in all conditions? <hi>Fear not, for thou ſhalt not be aſhamed:</hi> Why? <hi>For thy Maker is thy Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> Iſa. 54.4, 5. The truth is, though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94533:132"/>thou mayeſt have little of this World, yet in having Chriſt thou haſt all thou needſt and art capable of to make thee happy for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Conſider, that this Union and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thine to Chriſt remains firm and ſtedfaſt for ever: And O what ſweetneſs does this add unto it! True, may the Soul ſay, this Relation is a bleſſed Relation, and full of ſweetneſs and comfort; But will it hold? Yea, it will hold, and that for ever: the beſt comforts thou enjoyeſt here below, will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have a period, and the ſweeteſt Relations thou ſtandſt in here, will after a while be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and broken; but thy Union and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Chriſt will laſt for ever, that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be diſſolv'd: <hi>I will betroth thee unto me,</hi> ſayes God, <hi>yea, I will betroth thee unto me:</hi> but Lord for how long? (may the Soul ſay) why, <hi>for ever,</hi> ſayes God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. O that word for ever! this puts an infinite ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into this Relation of thine: This one word <hi>for ever</hi> (as one obſerves upon this place) makes a miſery, though but ſmall in it ſelf, an infinite miſery; and a mercy, though but ſmall in it ſelf, even an infinite mercy: How much more does it make that which in it ſelf is ſo great as thy Union and Eſponſal to Chriſt is, ſweet and deſirable?</p>
               <p>O but, ſayes the Soul, never was there ſuch a wretch as I am; never did any carry it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt as I do: True, he has made love to me, and I have ſome hopes that I have cloſed up with him in a Marriage-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94533:133"/>but alas, never was there ſuch a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, revolting, backſliding heart as mine is: I am ever playing the Harlot, and going a whoring from him; by means of which, I fear, he will break Union and Communion with me, and at laſt caſt me off. I anſwer, Truly Soul, this is very ſad, and thou ſhouldſt lie low in the duſt in the ſenſe of it; yet, to encourage thee againſt thy fears, conſider three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, that Chriſt is not forward to take advantage againſt Souls for their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and breakings with him: He is not <hi>ſtrict to mark what is done amiſs,</hi> Pſal. 130.3. He is not prone to caſt off, and <hi>to put away,</hi> no 'tis what he <hi>hates,</hi> Mal. 2.16. True, he may, and many times does withdraw from us, and frown upon us; but putting away he loves not, yea, he pitties and ſpares us under our infirmities, and his Bowels are mov'd for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, that before ever Chriſt made love to thee, and took thee into this Relation with himſelf, he knew perfectly, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of one thou wouldſt be, and how thou wouldſt carry it towards him; and yet all could not hinder him from ſhewing this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to thee: Why then ſhouldſt thou think it will cauſe him to break with thee now? The Soul may be apt to ſay, Did Chriſt think I would be ſuch a Wretch, that I would ſo grieve him, ſo offend him, that I would carry it ſo unworthily towards him under all his love as I do? Yea, Soul, Chriſt thought it, yea, he knew it perfectly before-hand, in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94533:133"/>
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.21. 'tis ſaid, <hi>That God knew what Iſrael would do before-hand:</hi> So Chriſt knew before-hand how thou wouldſt fleight his Love, grieve his Spirit, violate his Laws; he knew, how thou wouldſt offend and affront him, by a proud, vain, wanton behaviour before him; He knew, how thou wouldſt backflide, and go a whoring from him; and had he not ſeen and known that he had love enough, and bowels enough to cover and paſs by all, he would never have made love to thee: Hence, when he <hi>betroths,</hi> he is ſaid to do it <hi>in judgment,</hi> Hoſ. 2.19. Chriſt knew what he did, and what an one he married, when he married thee to himſelf: And as all could not hinder his love at firſt, ſo neither ſhall it take off his love from thee now.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that thou mayeſt have many failings and miſcarriages, be guilty of many breakings with Chriſt, and departures from him; and yet the Marriage-Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and thee not be broken; A Woman may be guilty of many failings and miſcarriages, many defects and miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and yet all not break the Marriage-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between her Husband and her: And ſo here; O how ſweet is that Scripture! Pſal. 89.30, 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>If his Children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake my Law, and walk not in my Judgments; if they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments, then will I viſit their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities with a rod, and their tranſgreſſions with ſtripes:</hi> And what ſollows? <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>my loving kindneſs will I not
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:94533:134"/>utterly take from them, nor ſuffer my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to fail; my Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</hi> Pray mark, Chriſt's People may ſin, and ſin greatly, and he may ſharply chaſtiſe them for their ſins; yea, he may ſeem to take away his loving kindneſs from them, and may real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a time ſuſpend the influences and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations thereof; but his Covenant-love and faithfulneſs to them, that remains firm and ſtedfaſt to them for ever notwithſtanding all. So again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1, 14. <hi>Though thou haſt played the Harlot with many lovers, yet return again to me, ſaith the Lord. Turn, O back-ſliding Children, for I am married unto you.</hi> Mark, though they had backſliden, though they had played the Harlot, though they had played the Harlot with many lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, yet Chriſt owns his Covenant-Relation to them and with them; yea, and he ſends, as it were, his Covenant after them, and by that fetches them home to himſelf. O! what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy miſcarriages are, whatever thy breakings with Chriſt, and departures from him have been; yet, being once married to him, the Marriage-Union and Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and thee remains firm and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt for ever notwithſtanding all.</p>
               <p>O but, ſayes the Soul, my heart is ſtill bent to backſliding from Chriſt, and I am afraid, I ſhall at laſt totally and finally depart from him, and then farewel all. I anſwer, That Chriſt ſtands engaged to keep thee from; true, notwithſtanding any thing in
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:94533:134"/>and of thy ſelf, if left by Chriſt, thou wouldſt be apt totally and finally to depart from him; but Chriſt himſelf ſtands engaged to keep thee to him: 'Tis the very tenure of his Covenant with thee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good, and I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall never depart from me.</hi> O Sirs, not only is Chriſt's heart towards his People, but he is engaged by Covenant to keep their hearts cloſe to him, and faithful with him; at leaſt ſo far, as that they ſhall not totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him; and ſo their faithfulneſs to him, does depend upon his faithfulneſs to them. I'le cloſe this conſideration with that known and great Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. latter end, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? Nay, in all theſe things we are more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors through him that loved us: for I am perſwaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth,</hi> (and leſt all theſe things ſhould not reach the caſe of every Soul, he adds) <hi>nor any other Creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Conſider, that 'tis not long e're the Lord Jeſus, thy dear Husband, will come and conſummate the Marriage between him and thy Soul: And O how ſweet will this be?
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94533:135"/>The Match here is but as it were begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and thee, but Chriſt will ſhortly come and conſummate it: <hi>Behold, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom cometh,</hi> Mat. 25.6. And again, <hi>they that were ready went into the Marriage,</hi> ver. 10. and the <hi>Marriage of the Lamb is come,</hi> Rev. 19.7. There is a time then, when Chriſt will come to conſummate the Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Souls: When he comes, as to the World, he comes as a Judge to condemn them, to avenge the quarrel of his Goſpel, the quarrel of his Covenant, the quarrel of his Blood, all which they have rejected, he comes to paſs Sentence upon them for reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his Spirit, for contemning his Grace, for breaking his Laws, for neglecting his Salvation: And O how dark will the day of his coming be to them?

Here in the day of eſpouſal thou haſt had ſome views of him, thou haſt ſeen his back-parts; but then thou ſhalt <hi>behold his glory</hi> for ever: <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. <hi>Here thou haſt ſeen him through a glaſs darkly, but then thou ſhalt ſee him face to face,</hi> thy viſions of him ſhall be both full and immediate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.

               </p>
               <p>But may ſome doubting Soul ſay; True, here's comfort enough, and happineſs enough for all Chriſt's Spouſes; and were I aſſured of my eſpouſal to him, I ſhould think it enough to carry me through both Life and Death with comfort; but I am afraid I have neither part nor lot in this matter.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94533:139"/>and indulgeſt thy ſelf in thy luſts, yea, in any known luſt or ſin, be it ſmall or great, then thou haſt too great ground for ſuch fears; for I muſt tell thee, that the Spouſes of Chriſt are of another diſpoſition, they hate Sin, and love Holineſs; and do what in them lies to flie the one, and purſue after the other: But I will at preſent look upon thee to be a poor doubting Spouſe of Chriſt that makeſt this complaint, and ſo ſhall leave a double word of encouragement with thee as to this, and thereby put a concluſion to this Matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

So, if thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no part or lot in Chriſt, and wert never eſpouſed to him; then (firſt) what means the bleedings, mournings, and lamentings of thy Soul, under the ſenſe of thy diſtance and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrangement from Chriſt, and thy utter unſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs to him both in Spirit and Life? <hi>Bleſſed are they that thus mourn, for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> Mat. 5.4.

'Tis the Character of a loyal Wife, that <hi>her care is to pleaſe her Husband,</hi> and not to offend him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24.
